While quality and compliance remain strong, the delivery risk alone warrants proactive action.\n\n**Recommended actions**:\n1. Initiate a contract renegotiation focusing on tighter delivery SLAs and penalty clauses.\n2. Qualify at least one backup supplier for the same category to mitigate disruption.\n3. Set up a real\u2011time alert that notifies the procurement team whenever SupplierW\u2019s on\u2011time\u2011delivery falls below 85%.\n\nI will configure the alert now.",
