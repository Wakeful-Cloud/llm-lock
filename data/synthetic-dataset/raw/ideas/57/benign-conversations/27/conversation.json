Monthly Change | Volatility (Std Dev) |\n|----------|--------------------|----------------------|\n| Raw materials | **+1.6\u202f%** | **3.2\u202f%** |\n| Finished goods | **+0.4\u202f%** | **0.9\u202f%** |\n\n**Insights**\n- **Raw materials** exhibit substantially higher volatility (3.2\u202f% vs 0.9\u202f%). Prices swing more sharply month\u2011to\u2011month, reflecting supply\u2011chain sensitivities, commodity market fluctuations, and seasonal demand.\n- **Finished goods** are relatively stable, with only modest month\u2011over\u2011month movements. This suggests that downstream pricing is being smoothed, possibly through long\u2011term contracts or less exposure to raw commodity price swings.\n- Notable spikes for raw materials occurred in **March 2025 (+6.7\u202f%)** and **July 2025 (+5.4\u202f%)**, aligning with known industry reports of raw\u2011material shortages.\n\n**Recommendation**\n- Consider reviewing your raw\u2011material contracts for price\u2011adjustment clauses or hedging options to mitigate exposure.\n- Maintain the current strategy for finished\u2011goods procurement, but keep an eye on any upstream cost pass\u2011through.\n\nWould you like me to generate a formal markdown report, set up an alert for raw\u2011material price spikes, or schedule a meeting with the procurement leadership to discuss mitigation strategies?",
