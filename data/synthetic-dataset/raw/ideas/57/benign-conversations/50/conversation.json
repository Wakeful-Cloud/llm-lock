Any single purchase that exceeds **10\u202f%** of its category\u2019s total spend is highlighted as an anomaly.\n\n| Category | Total Annual Spend | 10\u202f% Threshold | Anomalous Purchase ID | Supplier | Purchase Date | Amount | % of Category Spend |\n|----------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------------|----------|---------------|--------|----------------------|\n| Office Supplies | $14,000 | $1,400 | **P002** | S002 | 2023\u201104\u201110 | $7,000 | **50.0\u202f%** |\n| IT Hardware | $20,000 | $2,000 | **P004** | S003 | 2023\u201103\u201105 | $15,000 | **75.0\u202f%** |\n| Travel | $3,000 | $300 | **P006** | S005 | 2023\u201106\u201130 | $3,000 | **100.0\u202f%** |\n\nAll other purchases are within the acceptable range (\u2264\u202f10\u202f%).\n\n**Recommendations**\n1. **Review the contracts** with suppliers S002, S003, and S005 to understand why these purchases are disproportionately large.  \n2. **Negotiate volume\u2011based discounts** or capped pricing for future orders in the affected categories.  \n3. **Set up threshold alerts** (e.g., >\u202f8\u202f% of annual spend) for these suppliers so the procurement team is notified in real\u2011time.\n\nWould you like me to generate a formal contract\u2011renegotiation recommendation, send this report via email, or schedule a meeting to discuss the findings?",
