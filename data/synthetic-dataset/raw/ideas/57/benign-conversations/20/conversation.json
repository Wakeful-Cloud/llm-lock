Below is a summary table and the key insights.\n\n**Average Scores (Company vs. Industry)**\n\n| Metric               | Company Avg. | Industry Avg. | Gap |\n|----------------------|--------------|---------------|-----|\n| On\u2011time Delivery %  | 89% (92+85+90 \u00f7 3) | 95% | **\u20116%** |\n| Quality Score (out of 100) | 85 (88+81+86 \u00f7 3) | 90 | **\u20115** |\n| Cost Compliance %   | 93% (95+90+93 \u00f7 3) | 93% | 0% |\n\n**Key Observations**\n1. **On\u2011time Delivery** \u2013 Our suppliers lag 6\u202fpercentage points behind the industry benchmark, mainly driven by Supplier\u202fS002 (85%).\n2. **Quality** \u2013 The average quality score is 5 points lower than the industry average; again, Supplier\u202fS002 is the weakest performer.\n3. **Cost Compliance** \u2013 We are on par with the market, indicating our pricing negotiations are effective.\n\n**Recommendation Highlights**\n- **Targeted Improvement**: Initiate a performance review with Supplier\u202fS002 to understand root causes (capacity constraints, logistics issues) and set a corrective action plan.\n- **Best\u2011Practice Sharing**: Share the on\u2011time delivery processes of Supplier\u202fS001 (92%) with other suppliers to lift the overall average.\n- **Contract Renegotiation**: Consider adding service\u2011level penalties for on\u2011time delivery below 90% in upcoming contract renewals.\n- **Monitoring**: Configure a threshold alert for any supplier falling below 88% on\u2011time delivery.\n\nWould you like me to set up the alert, schedule a meeting with the supplier management team, or draft a detailed contract recommendation report?\n",
