Initiate a discussion with SupplierM to understand the cause of the delay (e.g., shipping constraints, production bottlenecks).\n2. Explore alternative suppliers that meet the 7\u2011day benchmark or negotiate service\u2011level improvements.\n3. Consider adding a performance\u2011based clause in the next contract renewal that incentivizes meeting or beating the 7\u2011day target.\n\nWould you like me to draft a contract\u2011renegotiation recommendation, set up a meeting with SupplierM, or configure an alert if their lead time exceeds a specific threshold?",
