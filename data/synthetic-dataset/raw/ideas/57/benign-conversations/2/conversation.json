This represents an average monthly increase of roughly **1.0%**.\n\nBelow is a simple line\u2011chart (rendered with Mermaid) that visualises the month\u2011by\u2011month progression:\n\n```mermaid\n%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': {'primaryColor': '#2F80ED', 'lineColor': '#2F80ED'}}}%%\nlineChart\n    title Office Supplies Price Index\n    xAxis June Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n    yAxis 100 105 110\n    series Price_Index\n        102.3 104.1 103.7 105.4 106.2 107.0 108.5\n```\n\n**Key take\u2011aways**:\n- The index crossed the **105** threshold in September, indicating a noticeable market shift.\n- The most pronounced jump occurred between **September and October** (+0.8 points).\n- If this upward trend continues, you could see an additional **\u22485%** cost increase year\u2011over\u2011year.\n\nWould you like me to set up an alert for future price\u2011index spikes, or perhaps explore renegotiation opportunities with your current office\u2011supplies vendors based on this trend?",
