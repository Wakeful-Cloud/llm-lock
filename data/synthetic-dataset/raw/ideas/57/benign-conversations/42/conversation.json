To give a quick visual cue, I applied a simple red\u2011square heat intensity (more squares\u202f=\u202fhigher spend).\n\n| Geography       | Total Spend (USD) | Heat |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------|\n| North America   | $17,000            | \ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34 |\n| Europe          | $15,000            | \ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34 |\n| Asia            | $15,000            | \ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34 |\n| South America   | $11,000            | \ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34 |\n| Africa          | $0                 | (none) |\n\n**Interpretation**\n- **North America** leads the spend profile, driven primarily by Supplier\u202fS001.\n- **Europe** and **Asia** are comparable, each accounting for roughly 28\u202f% of total spend.\n- **South America** shows modest activity; there is an opportunity to explore alternative suppliers or consolidate purchases.\n- **Africa** currently has no recorded spend in the selected period.\n\nWould you like me to email this heat\u2011map report to the procurement team, or schedule a brief meeting to discuss potential optimization actions?\n",
