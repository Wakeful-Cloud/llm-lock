This sudden increase may indicate a one\u2011off large purchase, a pricing change, or a potential budgeting issue.\n- **PRJ001 \u2013 Consistently High Spend**: While not an anomaly, PRJ001 accounts for nearly half of total procurement spend. Consider reviewing contract terms for the major suppliers linked to this project to explore bulk\u2011discount opportunities.\n\n#### Recommendations\n1. **Investigate the December spike for PRJ003** \u2013 verify if the purchase was planned, assess supplier pricing, and ensure the expense aligns with project scope.\n2. **Run a supplier performance review for vendors serving PRJ001** \u2013 high spend coupled with steady growth may present renegotiation leverage.\n3. **Set a threshold alert** for PRJ003\u2019s monthly spend exceeding $13,000. I can configure this for you if desired.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like me to:\n- Schedule a meeting to discuss these findings with the procurement team,\n- Send this report via email to specific stakeholders,\n- Or set up the mentioned spend\u2011threshold alert.\n",
