It references the recommended clause and includes the key data points underpinning the request.\n\n---\n**Subject:** Proposal to Add a Market\u2011Indexed Price Adjustment Clause to Our Upcoming Contract\n\n**Body:**\n\nHi [Account Manager Name],\n\nI hope you\u2019re well.\n\nAs we prepare to renew our agreement with **SupplierQ**, our procurement team has completed a review of the past year\u2019s spend and market trends for IT\u2011hardware.\u202fKey take\u2011aways:\n\n- **Annual spend with SupplierQ:** **$22,300**\n- **Market price index (IT hardware)** rose from **102.3** in Jan\u202f2023 to **108.4** in Dec\u202f2023 (average increase **\u2248\u202f5.5\u202f%**).\n- **SupplierQ\u2019s performance:** On\u2011time delivery **92\u202f%**, quality rating **88\u202f%**, cost\u2011efficiency **85\u202f%** \u2013 all above our internal benchmarks.\n\nBased on this analysis, we estimate that a modest price adjustment of **\u2248\u202f3\u202f%** would align the contract price with current market conditions while still reflecting the excellent service SupplierQ provides. To make future adjustments transparent and mutually beneficial, we propose adding the following clause to the renewed contract:\n\n> *\"Effective from the commencement date of the renewed agreement, the unit price for all IT\u2011hardware items supplied by SupplierQ shall be adjusted annually based on the most recent market price index for the category, with a maximum increase/decrease of 4\u202f% per year. The adjustment shall be calculated using the index published by the Global IT Hardware Price Index (GITHPI) for the preceding 12\u2011month period.\"*\n\nWe believe this clause will provide price stability for both parties and ensure that any market fluctuations are fairly shared.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts or if you\u2019d prefer to discuss this on a short call. I\u2019m available next week on **Tue\u202fOct\u202f15 (10:00\u202f\u2013\u202f11:00\u202fUTC)** or **Thu\u202fOct\u202f17 (14:00\u202f\u2013\u202f15:00\u202fUTC)** \u2013 happy to schedule a meeting at your convenience.\n\nThank you for your continued partnership.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nProcurement Lead\n[Your Company]\n[Phone] | [Email]\n---\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like any tweaks or if you\u2019d like me to send this email directly.",
