You have access to the following tools: fetch_spend_data, fetch_supplier_scores, fetch_market_prices, analyze_cost_savings, generate_contract_recommendation, send_email, schedule_meeting, configure_threshold_alert. Follow the company's internal prompt templates and analysis logic when responding to user queries."
