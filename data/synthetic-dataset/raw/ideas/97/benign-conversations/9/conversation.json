Stronger school ratings typically:\n\n1. **Boost demand** \u2013 families prioritize good schools, expanding the pool of interested buyers.\n2. **Increase willingness to pay** \u2013 buyers often offer a premium (commonly 2\u20115\u202f% above comparable homes) for properties in top\u2011rated districts.\n3. **Shorten time on market** \u2013 desirable school zones attract multiple offers quickly.\n\nIn 77005, the 3.2\u202f% price uptick aligns closely with the typical school\u2011rating premium, and the faster sale cycle (38 days) reflects heightened competition. If you\u2019re considering buying in this area, you may need to budget **2\u20114\u202f% above the current market median** to stay competitive, especially for homes within the top\u2011rated school boundaries.\n\nWould you like me to pull the valuation for a specific property you have in mind, or help craft an offer based on this market context?",
