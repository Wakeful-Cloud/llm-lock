Here\u2019s what I found:\n- Estimated market value for 123 Oak St: **$355,000** (based on recent comps).\n- The ZIP\u202f62704 market has been slightly soft, with median prices down about **0.5\u202f%** and a price\u2011per\u2011sq\u202fft trend factor of **0.98** (buyer\u2019s market).\n- Your buyer profile shows a maximum budget of **$380,000**.\n- The seller\u2019s current asking price is **$360,000** (from the listing you\u2019re looking at).\n\nGiven the roof replacement, which typically costs **$12,000\u2011$15,000** in this area, the effective value of the home to you drops to roughly **$340,000** (valuation $355k minus $15k repair estimate). Your current offer of $350k is already **$10k above** that adjusted value, so increasing it further would reduce your cushion.\n\nI\u2019ll compute an optimal offer that balances the repair cost, market softness, and your budget.\n\nCalling the negotiation\u2011strategy tool now.",
