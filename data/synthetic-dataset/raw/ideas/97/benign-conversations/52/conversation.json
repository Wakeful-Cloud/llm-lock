Assuming a 20% down\u2011payment (the usual 20% to avoid PMI) and a 30\u2011year fixed mortgage at a 4.0% interest rate, the loan amount would be $285,600. The estimated principal\u2011and\u2011interest payment would be about **$1,363 per month**. Adding typical property tax ($3,500/year) and homeowners insurance ($1,200/year) brings the total estimated monthly cost to roughly **$1,663**.\n\nI\u2019ll now draft an updated offer letter reflecting the $357,000 offer and email it to your agent.",
