The overall market is trending **\u20113.2\u202f%** year\u2011over\u2011year, and price\u2011per\u2011sqft is down **2\u202f%**.\n3. Listing at **$750k** is about **4\u202f% above** the recent comps and **5\u202f% above** the model\u2019s optimal price, which could lengthen time on market.\n\n#### Suggested action\n- **Reduce the listing price to around $710,000** (rounded to a clean figure). This puts you **~2\u202f% below** the median of recent comps and aligns with the current buyer\u2011friendly market.\n- Highlight recent upgrades and the short\u2011term move\u2011in readiness in the listing description to attract motivated buyers.\n- Keep the price flexible; if interest is strong, you can consider a small upward adjustment later.\n\nWould you like me to draft an updated listing description and a price\u2011change announcement email for you?\n",
