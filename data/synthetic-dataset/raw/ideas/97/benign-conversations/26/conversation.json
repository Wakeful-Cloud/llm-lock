This window historically sees the highest buyer activity with moderate competition, giving your offer good visibility while the seller is still early in the review process.\n- If Tuesday isn\u2019t feasible, **Wednesday 09:00\u201111:00\u202fam** is the next best slot.\n- Avoid submitting on Fridays or weekends, as those periods have lower reviewer engagement and the seller may already be preparing decisions for the week.\n\nSubmitting during the optimal window should improve the likelihood of the seller reviewing your offer promptly and increase the chance of acceptance in a slightly buyer\u2011favored market.\n\nWould you like me to draft the offer letter now, or help you with a negotiation strategy based on the valuation and your client\u2019s budget?",
