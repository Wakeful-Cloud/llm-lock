Financing\u2011only is weighted higher than inspection because it usually involves less renegotiation.\n- **Closing Timeline (30\u202f%)**: Earlier closings are preferred, but the benefit is capped so that a significantly lower price does not get a disproportionate boost.\n\n#### Recommendation\n- **Best overall value:** **Offer C** \u2013 it offers the highest price with only a financing contingency and a reasonable closing window.\n- **If speed is critical:** Offer B closes the fastest, but you would be accepting $10k less than Offer C.\n- **If you prefer fewer contingencies:** Offer C again wins, as it limits buyer conditions to financing only.\n\nWould you like me to draft an acceptance letter for Offer C or a counter\u2011offer for any of the others?",
