Based on the historical school impact, you can expect home values to rise an additional **3\u20115%** over the next 12\u201124\u202fmonths, on top of the current 4.2% annual growth.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering buying, moving quickly could lock in a price before the full school\u2011driven appreciation kicks in. Conversely, if you\u2019re selling, now might be a good time to list, as buyers will soon be competing for homes near the new school.\n\nWould you like me to pull specific property valuations in Maple Grove or draft an offer strategy based on this outlook?",
