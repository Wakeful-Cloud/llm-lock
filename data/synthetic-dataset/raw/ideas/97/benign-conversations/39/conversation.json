Taxes are due after you take ownership and are prorated at closing.\n- **Transfer taxes:** Illinois imposes a real\u2011estate transfer tax of $0.10 per $100 of the sale price, plus a county tax (e.g., $0.25 per $100 in Sangamon County). On a $306,000 purchase, expect roughly $460 in state tax and $765 in county tax.\n- **Mortgage interest deduction:** If you itemize, you can deduct mortgage interest on the loan up to the IRS limits.\n- **Property tax deduction:** You may also deduct the property taxes you pay, subject to the SALT cap.\n- **Capital gains:** Should you sell the home later, you may qualify for the $250k/$500k exclusion on capital gains if it\u2019s your primary residence.\n\nBecause tax situations vary, I recommend consulting a tax professional to understand how these rules apply to you.\n\nWould you like me to send this offer letter to the seller (jane.smith@example.com) and copy you (john.doe@example.com)?",
