Compute the optimal initial offer price based on the following inputs:\n- valuation: estimated market value of the property (USD)\n- market_trend_factor: multiplier derived from recent market trends (e.g., 0.97 for a buyer's market)\n- buyer_budget_max: maximum amount the buyer is willing to pay (USD)\n- seller_asking_price: current listing price set by the seller (USD)\n\nApply the weighting formula:\n```\noptimal_offer = 0.4 * valuation\n               + 0.3 * (valuation * market_trend_factor)\n               + 0.2 * buyer_budget_max\n               - 0.1 * seller_asking_price\n```\nMake sure the final offer does not exceed buyer_budget_max and tries to stay within 5% of the valuation after adjustments.\n```",
