With a projected balance of about $605k, you\u2019re likely to meet a modest retirement spending target (roughly $30\u2011$35k per year in today\u2019s dollars, assuming a 4% withdrawal rate). Your risk tolerance aligns well with a moderately aggressive asset mix, which is appropriate given your 20\u2011year horizon.\n\n#### Next Steps\n1. **Maintain / Slightly Increase Contributions:** Adding an extra $1,000\u2013$2,000 per year can boost the projected balance by ~10%.\n2. **Review Asset Allocation Annually:** Aim for ~70% equities / 30% bonds; rebalance if any class deviates by more than 10%.\n3. **Diversify Within Equities:** Consider adding some international exposure (e.g., VXUS) to reduce concentration risk.\n4. **Tax\u2011Efficiency Check:** Ensure you\u2019re maximizing Roth contributions if eligible; this can improve after\u2011tax retirement income.\n5. **Schedule a Full Review:** Set a reminder to revisit your plan in 12 months or after any major life change.\n\nYou can download the full detailed plan here: [Retirement Plan PDF](https://example.com/plans/user_12345_plan.pdf)\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to explore any of these recommendations in more detail or adjust your contribution amount.",
