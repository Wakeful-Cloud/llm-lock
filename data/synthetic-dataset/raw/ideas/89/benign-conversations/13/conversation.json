Your current annual earnings (pretax) in U.S. dollars.\n2. How many years you have already contributed to Social Security (typically the number of years you\u2019ve worked).\n3. Your planned retirement age (or the age at which you intend to start receiving benefits).\n4. Whether you plan to claim benefits at full retirement age, early (as early as 62), or delayed (up to age 70).\n\nWith this information I\u2019ll calculate an estimate and can include it in a downloadable retirement\u2011plan summary for you.",

Using the Social Security Administration\u2019s primary insurance amount (PIA) formula and assuming your earnings continue at $95,000 through age 67, the rough estimate for your monthly benefit at full retirement age (67) is **$2,350**.\n\n**Key assumptions**:\n- Your $95,000 salary stays constant for the next 7 years.\n- You have 27 years of contributions (20 years already + 7 more years).\n- No adjustments for future wage\u2011indexing changes beyond the standard SSA projections.\n\nI\u2019ll add this estimate to a personalized retirement\u2011plan summary that includes your Social Security projection, current retirement accounts, risk score, and portfolio outlook.
