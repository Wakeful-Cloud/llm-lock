For a $46,000 withdrawal, that\u2019s **$46,000\u202f\u2013\u202f$92,000**.\n\nGiven your current cash holding of $12,000, I recommend increasing your cash allocation to **roughly 8\u201110\u202f% of the projected portfolio**, i.e., **$92,000\u2013$115,000** in cash when you retire.

Allocate an additional $5,000\u2011$10,000 per year from equity contributions to short\u2011term cash/T\u2011bills.\n  2. Rebalance annually to maintain 70/25/5 equity/bond/cash split, gradually increasing cash to target range as retirement approaches.\n- **Assumptions:** Constant annual contribution of $20,000, inflation at 2.5% (embedded in market forecasts), no major life\u2011event changes.\n\nYou can download the full PDF report below."
