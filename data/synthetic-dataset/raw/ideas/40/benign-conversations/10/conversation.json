It also has a nearer deadline, giving you a bit more time to prepare a robust proposal. I suggest prioritizing the NSF grant while keeping the DOE grant as a secondary option in case you want to diversify funding sources.\n\nWould you like me to generate a draft outline for the NSF grant application, or set up a reminder for the DOE deadline?\n",
