This project directly advances NSF\u2019s mission to promote the progress of science by developing innovative machine\u2011learning techniques for high\u2011resolution climate modeling, thereby improving our ability to predict extreme weather events.\n\nMy research over the past decade has focused on integrating deep learning with physical climate models.  Notably, I served as the Principal Investigator on the NSF\u2011funded project **AI\u2011Driven Climate Forecasting** (Award #XXXXXX, $200,000, 2021), which produced a published framework now used by several climate research centers.  My recent publications in *Nature Climate Change* and *Journal of Machine Learning Research* highlight my expertise in this interdisciplinary area.\n\nThe anticipated broader impacts of the proposed work include (1) training a cohort of graduate students and post\u2011doctoral researchers in cutting\u2011edge AI for climate science, (2) releasing open\u2011source software tools to the broader research community, and (3) engaging K\u201112 educators through outreach modules that translate complex climate data into classroom\u2011friendly materials.\n\nThank you for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to NSF\u2019s visionary research agenda.\n\nSincerely,\n\n**Dr. Alex Rivera**\nPrincipal Investigator\nUniversity of Example\nEmail: alex.rivera@example.edu\nPhone: (555) 123\u20114567\n---\n\nFeel free to modify any section while keeping the formatting (12\u2011pt Times New Roman, double\u2011spaced, 1\u2011inch margins) as required by NSF.",
