By integrating high\u2011resolution hydrodynamic modeling with locally collected socio\u2011economic datasets, we will produce actionable flood risk maps that identify hotspots of potential loss.\n\n**Policy and Planning:**  The resulting risk assessments will be co\u2011developed with the City of Seattle\u2019s Office of Emergency Management. Together, we will create priority lists for infrastructure upgrades (e.g., green storm\u2011water infrastructure, levee reinforcement) and improve evacuation routing plans. These tools will inform the city\u2019s Climate Action Plan and can be adopted by other municipalities facing similar climate\u2011driven challenges.\n\n**Community Outreach:**  Partnering with local non\u2011profits such as the Seattle Climate Justice Coalition, we will translate scientific results into plain\u2011language briefs and community workshops. This will raise awareness among at\u2011risk households about flood preparedness measures, thereby reducing injuries and property damage during extreme events.\n\n**Broader Dissemination:**  All modeling code and datasets will be released under an open\u2011source license on GitHub, accompanied by detailed documentation and tutorials. This will enable researchers and practitioners nationwide to replicate and adapt our approach for their own regions, scaling the impact of our work beyond the Pacific Northwest.\n\nBy delivering scientifically robust, policy\u2011relevant, and community\u2011focused outcomes, this research aligns with NSF\u2019s call for proposals that *\u201cclearly describe how the research will benefit vulnerable populations, reduce climate\u2011related risks, and inform policy.\u201d*  The anticipated reduction in flood\u2011related losses and the empowerment of underserved communities constitute a measurable societal benefit that justifies the requested award.\n---\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like any revisions or additional details (e.g., specific metrics for impact evaluation, partnership letters, or budgeting notes).",
