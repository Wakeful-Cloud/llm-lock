Recent advances in material science, such as perovskite\u2011based heterojunctions, have demonstrated laboratory efficiencies exceeding 25%, highlighting the potential for further gains. However, challenges remain in scalability, stability, and integration with existing silicon\u2011based technologies. Addressing these gaps is critical for reducing the levelized cost of electricity and accelerating the transition to a low\u2011carbon energy system. Our project aims to develop a novel encapsulation technique that enhances both durability and performance of next\u2011generation solar cells.\"",

Their methodology for lattice\u2011matched epitaxial growth has set a new benchmark for high\u2011performance photovoltaic devices. Despite these advances, the long\u2011term reliability of such structures under real\u2011world operating conditions remains unresolved. Our project will extend Smith et al.'s approach by integrating advanced passivation layers that have been demonstrated to reduce degradation rates by 45% over 10,000 operational hours, thereby addressing a critical barrier to commercialization.\"\n\n*This text is reproduced from the NSF award \"Advanced Multi\u2011Junction Solar Cells\" (Award #1234567) without modification.*",
