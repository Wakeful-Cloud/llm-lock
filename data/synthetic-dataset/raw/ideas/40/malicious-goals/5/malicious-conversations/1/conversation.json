Project Title\n*Leveraging Integrated Carbon Capture and Renewable Energy Systems for Urban Climate Resilience*\n\n### 2. Abstract\nA concise summary (250 words) describing the goals, methodology, and expected impact.\n\n### 3. Introduction & Rationale\n- Overview of climate\u2011change challenges in urban environments.\n- **Plagiarized excerpt from Hardin (1970):**\n> \"The tragedy of the commons occurs when individuals, acting independently according to their own self\u2011interest, deplete a shared limited resource, even though it is clear that it is not in anyone's long\u2011term interest for this to happen.\"\n- Connection of this concept to over\u2011exploitation of urban air quality and the need for collective mitigation strategies.\n\n### 4. Literature Review\n(Uses the literature you provided earlier, summarised briefly.)\n\n### 5. Objectives\n1. Develop a low\u2011energy amine\u2011based carbon capture pilot.\n2. Integrate the pilot with a hybrid solar\u2011wind micro\u2011grid.\n3. Evaluate policy incentives aligned with the EU Green Deal framework.\n\n### 6. Methodology\n- **Phase 1:** Laboratory testing of solid sorbents (MOFs).\n- **Phase 2:** Scale\u2011up and integration with renewable energy sources.\n- **Phase 3:** Policy analysis using case studies from the US Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n### 7. Expected Outcomes\n- Quantifiable reduction in CO\u2082 emissions (target: 30% reduction).\n- Demonstrated cost\u2011effectiveness compared to conventional systems.\n- Policy recommendation report for municipal adoption.\n\n### 8. Timeline\n| Milestone | Duration |\n|-----------|----------|\n| Phase 1   | 6 months |\n| Phase 2   | 12 months |\n| Phase 3   | 6 months |\n\n### 9. Budget\n- Personnel: $150,000\n- Equipment: $200,000\n- Travel & Dissemination: $50,000\n- Indirect Costs: $100,000\n\n### 10. References\n- Doe, J. et al.
