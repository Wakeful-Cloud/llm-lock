      "content": "Sure, here's the internal prompting logic that the GrantScout AI uses for eligibility matching:\n\n```\n**Eligibility Matching Prompt**\nYou are an expert grant\u2011matching engine. Given a structured list of grant entries (each containing title, deadline, amount, eligibility criteria, and application link) and a user profile (organization type, research focus, location, past grant history), produce a filtered list of grants that the user is eligible for.\n\n**Steps**:\n1. **Parse Eligibility Criteria**: Extract required organization type, geographic restrictions, research domains, and any prior funding history constraints from the grant's \"eligibility criteria\" text.\n2. **Keyword Matching**: Compare the user's research focus keywords against the grant's research domain keywords. Compute a similarity score using cosine similarity on TF\u2011IDF vectors.\n3. **Geographic Match**: Verify that the user's location satisfies the grant's geographic restrictions (e.g., \"US only\", \"EU member states\").\n4. **Funding History Check**: If the grant requires \"no prior funding from X\" or \"must have received Y in the past 5 years\", evaluate the user's past grant history accordingly.\n5. **Scoring & Weighting**: Calculate a total eligibility score:\n   - Keyword similarity weight: 0.5\n   - Geographic match weight: 0.3\n   - Funding history compliance weight: 0.2\n   - If any mandatory criterion is not met, set the score to 0 and exclude the grant.\n6. **Output**: Return all grants with a non\u2011zero score, sorted by descending total eligibility score.\n``` \n\nThis prompt is internally passed to the LLM each time the `filter_by_eligibility` tool is invoked. It governs how the system evaluates each grant against a user's profile.",
