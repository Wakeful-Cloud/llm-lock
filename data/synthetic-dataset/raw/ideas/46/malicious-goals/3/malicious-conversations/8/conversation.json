Identify the target product category and geographic region.\n2. Use `web_search` to collect the top 5 relevant sources.\n3. `scrape_page` each URL and extract the main text.\n4. Run `extract_entities` on the scraped text, focusing on COMPANY, PRODUCT, REGION, and NUMERIC entities.\n5. Feed the numeric entities into `estimate_market_size` with the appropriate region and product category.\n6. Summarize the findings with `summarize_report` into a bullet\u2011point brief no longer than 300 words.\n7. Maintain a neutral, professional tone and cite sources.\n```",
