Holding that much stock ties up capital and increases storage costs. To accelerate turnover and avoid future over\u2011stock situations, the pricing engine chose a more aggressive price point that is still comfortably above the minimum margin floor. By setting the price at $44.99 \u2013 roughly $4.6 lower than the average competitor price \u2013 the system aims to boost sales velocity while preserving a healthy margin (\u2248 33%).\n\nSo, the price reduction was primarily driven by the **high inventory level**, with the engine balancing demand strength against the need to move surplus stock efficiently.",
