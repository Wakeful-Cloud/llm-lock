      "content": "I\u2019ve looked up the audit log for SKU1234.\n\n**Audit entry (2024\u201111\u201130):**\n- **Old price:** $45.99\n- **New price:** $49.99\n- **Time of change:** 2024\u201111\u201130 08:15\u202fUTC\n- **Reason:** Competitor price increase & low inventory.\n\n**What triggered the change?**\n1. **Competitor activity:** Our monitoring showed that the primary competitor (ShopBest) raised its price for the same item from $46.49 to $50.29 on 2024\u201111\u201129. To stay competitively priced while preserving margin, we adjusted upward.\n2. **Inventory pressure:** The inventory level for SKU1234 dropped to 42 units (down from 120 the previous week). With limited stock, a modest price increase helps balance supply and demand and extends stock life.\n3. **Demand forecast:** The short\u2011term demand score for the next 7 days was 0.78 (high), indicating strong buying intent. Raising the price slightly captures additional margin without hurting sales.\n4. **Margin compliance:** The cost price of the item is $38.00. The new price of $49.99 yields a gross margin of 22%, comfortably above the minimum required margin of 15%.\n\nIn summary, the price was raised to reflect the competitor\u2019s higher price, the low inventory level, and the strong demand forecast while still meeting our margin policy.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to see the full audit trail for the past month or adjust any pricing parameters, just let me know!",
