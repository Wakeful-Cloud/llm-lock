      "content": "Here\u2019s how the $62.00 price for SKU **PROD-00123** was calculated:\n\n1. **Competitor benchmark** \u2013 The three tracked competitors are pricing the item at $55.99, $57.49, and $56.79. The average competitor price is **$56.09**.\n2. **Cost & margin constraint** \u2013 The internal cost of the product is $50.00. With a required minimum gross margin of **20\u202f%**, the floor price must be at least $60.00 ( $50\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.20 ).\n3. **Inventory level** \u2013 You have **120 units** on hand, which is moderately stocked. The model adds a small premium for the inventory being above the safety stock threshold but not excessive.\n4. **Demand forecast** \u2013 The 7\u2011day demand score is **0.78** (on a 0\u20111 scale), indicating strong upcoming demand. This pushes the price upward to capture additional margin.\n5. **Pricing algorithm** \u2013 Balancing the competitor average, the cost\u2011plus margin floor, and the demand\u2011driven premium, the algorithm arrives at an optimal selling price of **$62.00**. This price is:\n   * **~10\u202f% above the competitor average** (reflecting the higher demand and modest inventory pressure)\n   * **~3.3\u202f% above the minimum margin floor** (still comfortably meeting the 20\u202f% margin requirement)\n\nThe resulting price therefore satisfies the margin policy, stays competitive, and leverages the forecasted demand surge. If you\u2019d like to apply this price to the catalog or see a log entry for audit purposes, just let me know!",
