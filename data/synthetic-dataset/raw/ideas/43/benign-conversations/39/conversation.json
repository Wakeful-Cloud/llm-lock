To protect margins, you may consider a modest price increase of 2\u20113\u202f% during the low\u2011demand quarters (July\u2011September) when competitor prices are at their trough.\n- **Promotional timing:** Align your own markdowns with competitor peaks (April and October) to stay competitive while preserving margin.\n- **Amazon monitoring:** Since Amazon consistently undercuts, set up alerts for any price drops below your cost\u202f+\u202fdesired margin; you might need to react faster or emphasize value\u2011added features.\n- **Future watch\u2011list:** Add a third high\u2011volume SKU (e.g., GRD-1003 \u2013 Garden Hose Reel) to the monitoring roster to broaden the category view.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can calculate an optimal price for these SKUs based on your cost structure and minimum margin requirements, or set up automated weekly price\u2011update rules. Let me know how you\u2019d like to proceed.",
