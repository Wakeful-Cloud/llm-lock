Competitor lowest price: **$18.49** (eBay). Margin is being eroded.\n2. **SKU002** \u2013 Current store price: **$35.00**. Competitor lowest price: **$32.00** (eBay). Still within margin but trending down.\n3. **SKU003** \u2013 Current store price: **$12.00**. Competitor lowest price: **$11.50** (eBay). Very tight competition.\n\nThese SKUs have not been adjusted in the past month despite the competitive pressure shown above. I recommend reviewing them for a possible price reduction or promotion to stay competitive while respecting your minimum margin requirements.",
