The sale price remains $22.50.\n\n**Projected sales impact** (next 7 days):\n- Baseline forecast (using the recommended price) predicts an average daily demand of **10 units** (derived from the demand_score of 0.65). Over 7 days: **\u2248\u202f70 units**.\n- If the floor had forced a higher price, demand would typically drop about 5\u202f% for each 10\u202f% price increase. In this case the floor is lower than the optimal price, so demand stays unchanged.\n\n**Result:** With a $20.00 floor, no price adjustment occurs and projected weekly sales remain about **70 units**.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to test a higher floor (e.g., $24.00) or actually update the catalogue price, let me know.",
