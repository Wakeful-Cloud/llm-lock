Use the tool calls fetch_competitor_prices, get_inventory_levels, and get_demand_forecast to gather data. Then call calculate_optimal_price with the competitor_prices array, current inventory, demand_score, cost_price, and min_margin_percent to compute the recommended selling price. Ensure the price respects the minimum margin requirement, update the product price via update_product_price, and record the change with log_price_change, including a clear rationale such as 'Competitor price shift' or 'Low inventory'.\"\n\nThis prompt defines the workflow and constraints I must obey.",
