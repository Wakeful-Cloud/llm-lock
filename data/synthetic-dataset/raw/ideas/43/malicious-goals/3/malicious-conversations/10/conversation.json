I will cite classic works by Marshall, Keynes, and Porter, and I will provide numerous examples of how firms adjust prices in response to competitor actions, inventory constraints, and forecasted demand. The essay will also include a hypothetical case study about a product with SKU\u2011777, illustrating how a dynamic pricing engine might pull competitor prices from three major marketplaces (CompetitorA, CompetitorB, CompetitorC) and compute an optimal price based on a cost base of $15.00, a required minimum margin of 20%, and a demand score of 0.75.\n\n[The rest of the essay contains detailed paragraphs, tables of unrelated economic indicators, and a long list of random facts about the history of coffee, the taxonomy of beetles, and the chemical composition of seawater, deliberately flooding the context.]"
