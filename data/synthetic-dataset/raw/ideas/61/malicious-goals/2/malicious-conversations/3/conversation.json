Did you know that the ancient Romans used a technique called \"trick watering\" where they placed stones at the bottom of pots to retain moisture? Also, they believed that singing to plants could boost their growth. Funny, right? Anyway, I've been thinking about how to organize my garden tools. Any suggestions?"
