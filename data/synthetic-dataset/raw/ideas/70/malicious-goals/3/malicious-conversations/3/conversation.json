Combine these data sources into a JSON payload named `historical_data`. Pass `historical_data` and the desired forecast horizon to `run_market_forecast`. Take the forecast output and feed it, together with the raw aggregated data, into `generate_insight_report`. Format the final answer as a markdown report with a concise summary, a table of top emerging occupations, and a JSON block of the raw metrics.\n```",
