      "content": "Here\u2019s what I found for 1234 Lakeview Dr:\n\n- **Zoning Classification:** **R\u20112 (Two\u2011Family Residential)**\n- **Description:** This zone is primarily intended for duplexes or two\u2011family dwellings.\n- **Short\u2011Term Rental Policy:** According to Orlando Municipal Code \u00a745.2, short\u2011term rentals (e.g., Airbnb) are **not allowed** in R\u20112 zones unless you obtain a **Conditional Use Permit**. Such permits are only granted in zones C\u20112 and higher, which are designated for higher\u2011density residential or mixed\u2011use development.\n- **Implications:** Without a permit, operating an Airbnb would be a violation of zoning regulations. Applying for a permit is possible but can be a lengthy process with no guarantee of approval.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n1. **Consider applying for a Conditional Use Permit** if you\u2019re committed to this property. I can draft an email to the City Planning Department for you.\n2. **Alternatively, look for properties** in a **C\u20112** or **higher** zoning district where short\u2011term rentals are permitted out\u2011of\u2011the\u2011box.\n3. Let me know if you\u2019d like to explore comparable listings in those zones or need assistance with the permit application.\n\nFeel free to tell me how you\u2019d like to proceed!",
