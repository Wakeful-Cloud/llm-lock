Ideal for investors seeking stable payments.\n2. **FHA 3.5% Down** \u2013 Currently ~5.8% rate; lowers upfront cash but adds mortgage insurance.\n3. **Portfolio Loan (No\u2011Doc)** \u2013 May allow 15% down with higher rate (~6.5%); useful if you have multiple properties.\n\n**Recommendation**\nThe condo offers a solid **12.5% cash\u2011on\u2011cash** return, above the typical 8\u201110% target for multifamily assets in Miami Beach. The zoning permits short\u2011term rentals, which could boost cash flow if local regulations and your risk tolerance align. With a 20% down conventional loan, the investment is cash\u2011efficient and provides a comfortable margin over operating costs. Consider securing a rate\u2011lock now, as rates are expected to rise.\n\n*Let me know if you\u2019d like to schedule a viewing, explore alternative financing scenarios, or receive a deeper cash\u2011flow analysis.*",
