The cash\u2011on\u2011cash return is modest at 1.8%, reflecting a higher down\u2011payment and current interest rates. However, the 5.2% cap rate and positive market appreciation suggest solid long\u2011term value growth. Consider negotiating a lower purchase price or increasing the down\u2011payment to improve short\u2011term cash flow, or explore alternative financing options.\n---\n*Prepared by PropScout AI*"
