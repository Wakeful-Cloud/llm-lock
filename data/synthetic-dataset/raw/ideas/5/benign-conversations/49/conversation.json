In practice, you\u2019d aim for at least **90\u201195\u202f% occupancy** to comfortably cover both expenses and debt while maintaining a profit margin.\n\n### Quick ROI Snapshot (from the tool)\n- Monthly mortgage payment: **$954.83**\n- Annual net cash flow (after mortgage & expenses): **$9,668**\n- Cash\u2011on\u2011cash return: **9.67\u202f%**\n- Overall ROI: **5.12\u202f%**\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a full investment report, explore financing options, or schedule a viewing for this property!",
