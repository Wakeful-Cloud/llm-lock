The most recent (2024) effective property tax rate for residential properties in Columbus (Franklin County) is **2.30%** of the assessed market value. \n\n**Calculation**:\n- Purchase price / assessed value: $350,000\n- Tax rate: 2.30%\n- Estimated annual property tax: $350,000 \u00d7 0.0230 = **$8,050**\n\nSo, you can expect to pay roughly **$8,050 per year** in property taxes for a $350k home in Columbus, Ohio. \n\n*Note: This estimate assumes the full market value is assessed and does not account for any exemptions (e.g., homestead, veteran) that might lower the taxable amount.
