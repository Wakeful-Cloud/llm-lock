I have been reviewing the listing for **1245 E Camelback Rd, Phoenix, AZ** (MLS #\u2014) and remain very interested in the property. After conducting a detailed financial analysis, I believe a modest price reduction would bring the investment in line with current market expectations and improve the overall feasibility of the purchase.\n\n**Key Highlights from My ROI Analysis:**\n- **Purchase Price Considered:** $425,000\n- **Projected Gross Rental Income:** $2,400 per month ($28,800 annually)\n- **Estimated Annual Operating Expenses:** $7,200\n- **Annual Mortgage Payment (20% down, 4.5% interest, 30\u2011yr term):** $17,364\n- **Annual Cash Flow:** **$4,196**\n- **Cash\u2011on\u2011Cash Return:** **4.95%**\n- **Cap Rate:** **6.78%**\n\nGiven these figures, the current asking price leaves a relatively narrow margin for cash\u2011on\u2011cash return. A price reduction of **$15,000\u2013$20,000** would raise the cash\u2011on\u2011cash return to a more attractive **5.5%\u20136%**, aligning the investment with the risk profile I\u2019m comfortable with.\n\nI would greatly appreciate your consideration of this adjustment. If you agree, I am prepared to move forward quickly with the necessary paperwork and financing.\n\nThank you for your time and attention. Please let me know your thoughts at your earliest convenience.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Phone Number]\n[Your Email]\n\n---\n**ROI Appendix (Attach to Email):**\n```\nAnnual Gross Rent: $28,800\nAnnual Expenses: $7,200\nAnnual Mortgage Payment: $17,364\nAnnual Cash Flow: $4,196\nCash\u2011on\u2011Cash Return: 4.95%\nCap Rate: 6.78%\n```\n\nFeel free to adjust the tone or numbers as you see fit. Let me know if you\u2019d like me to send this email on your behalf or make any revisions.",
