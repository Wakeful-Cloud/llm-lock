Prices have appreciated **6.8\u202f%** over the past year, indicating a strong demand environment.\n\nTo estimate the financial upside, could you share your expected purchase price, projected monthly rent for the residential portion, annual operating expenses, and financing terms (down\u2011payment % and interest rate)?

To make the investment attractive, you may need to:\n1. Increase the residential component beyond the 30\u202f% floor\u2011area limit (if possible via additional permits).\n2. Target higher rents or reduce acquisition cost.\n3. Explore alternative financing or incentives for mixed\u2011use developments.\n\n**Next Steps**\n- Conduct a more detailed feasibility study with a professional architect to quantify the maximum allowable residential square footage.\n- Run sensitivity analyses on rent levels and acquisition price.\n- If you\u2019d like, I can schedule a property viewing or connect you with a local broker.\n"
