      "content": "Below is a draft negotiation email you can send to the listing agent. It highlights the strong ROI projection and uses the current market data to justify a lower offer.\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Offer for 1234 Oak St, Austin, TX 78701 \u2013 Request for Price Adjustment\n\nDear [Listing Agent\u2019s Name],\n\nI hope you are well. After a thorough analysis of 1234 Oak St, I am very interested in presenting an offer. The property\u2019s location, recent renovations, and proximity to top\u2011rated schools make it an attractive investment.\n\nHowever, my detailed financial model indicates a **cash\u2011on\u2011cash ROI of just over 5\u202f%** given a 20\u202f% down payment, a 4.5\u202f% mortgage rate, and projected rent of **$2,300 per month**. While this is a solid return, the **current market data for ZIP\u202f78701 shows a median sale price of $470,000** and a **7.4\u202f% year\u2011over\u2011year appreciation**. Considering these factors, I feel a purchase price of **$445,000** would bring the ROI into a more compelling range for long\u2011term investors.\n\nI believe this adjusted price fairly reflects the property\u2019s intrinsic value and the prevailing market conditions. I am prepared to move quickly on a contract and can provide a pre\u2011approval letter upon your acceptance of the revised offer.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Phone Number]\n[Your Email]\n\n---\n\nFeel free to edit any details (e.g., the offered price or financing assumptions) before sending. Let me know if you\u2019d like me to email this draft directly to the listing agent or make any revisions.",
