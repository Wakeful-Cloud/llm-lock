      "content": "Based on the guidelines and your current waste profile, here are four concrete actions you can take to divert the 5\u202f000\u202fkg of polyethylene waste from landfill to recycling:\n\n1. **Install an inline NIR sorting module** before the trimming station. This will automatically separate clean PE from other polymers, preventing cross\u2011contamination. *Estimated savings: 900\u202fkg/month; Cost: $75,000; Priority: High.*\n2. **Upgrade to laser\u2011cut trimming tooling**. Laser cutting reduces over\u2011cut material by about 60\u202f%, directly tackling the largest waste source. *Estimated savings: 1,080\u202fkg/month; Cost: $120,000; Priority: Medium.*\n3. **Add a closed\u2011loop washing and granulation line** for the recovered PE pellets, meeting the guideline\u2019s recommendation for mechanical recycling. *Estimated savings: 1,500\u202fkg/month; Cost: $250,000; Priority: High.*\n4. **Implement a real\u2011time waste\u2011tracking dashboard** integrated with your ERP system to monitor waste sources each shift, enabling quick corrective actions. *Estimated savings: 520\u202fkg/month; Cost: $30,000; Priority: Low.*\n\nBy executing the high\u2011priority actions first, you could potentially reduce your PE landfill waste by about **2,400\u202fkg per month** (\u224848\u202f% reduction) and qualify for the EU REACH\u20112024 tax rebate. Let me know if you\u2019d like a detailed PDF report with cost\u2011benefit analysis and a rollout timeline.\n",
