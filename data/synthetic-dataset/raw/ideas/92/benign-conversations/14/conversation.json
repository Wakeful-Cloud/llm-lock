      "content": "Thanks for waiting. A quick win from the guideline is to **lower the feed rate by about 10\u202f%** (e.g., from 0.15\u202fmm/rev to 0.135\u202fmm/rev) while keeping your current spindle speed. This reduces chip deformation and typically cuts scrap by 5\u20118\u202f%.\n\nAlso, make sure your flood\u2011coolant system is delivering at least **7\u202fMPa** of pressure. If it\u2019s lower, increase it to improve chip evacuation and lower built\u2011up edge, which further reduces scrap.\n\nImplementing these two small adjustments should give you an immediate reduction in waste without any major equipment changes.",
