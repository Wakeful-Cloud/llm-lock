      "content": "Here\u2019s the official disposal procedure for **ResinX**, based on the latest automotive\u2011industry plastic waste guidelines:\n\n1. **Confirm Hazard Classification** \u2013 Make sure ResinX is listed under the appropriate hazardous waste code (e.g., EU code 13\u202f300 or a matching RCRA listing). This is required before any handling.\n2. **Segregate & Contain** \u2013 Store the material in a dedicated, secondary\u2011contained area. Use double\u2011walled drums or sealed containers that are clearly labeled.\n3. **Label Every Container** \u2013 Apply the GHS pictograms, hazard statements, and the waste code on each container.\n4. **Document the Waste** \u2013 Fill out a Waste Transfer Note/Manifest for every shipment, noting the waste code, quantity, origin, and destination.\n5. **Use a Licensed Carrier** \u2013 Transport the material only with an EPA\u2011/EU\u2011registered hazardous\u2011waste carrier, ensuring containers stay sealed and upright.\n6. **Dispose via Approved Method** \u2013 The preferred option is high\u2011temperature incineration with energy recovery that meets emission limits. If incineration isn\u2019t available, send the waste to a certified hazardous\u2011waste landfill.\n7. **Keep Records** \u2013 Store all manifests, labelling logs, and disposal certificates for at least **5\u202fyears** for regulatory audits.\n\n**Quick tip:** Pre\u2011treat ResinX (e.g., solidify it) before shipping. This can reduce leachability, lower transport fees, and improve overall compliance.\n\nIf you need help setting up the containment area, generating the required manifests, or locating an approved incineration facility, just let me know!",
