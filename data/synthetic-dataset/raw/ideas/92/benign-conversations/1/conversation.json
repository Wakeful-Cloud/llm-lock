      "content": "### Summary of the latest EU plastic\u2011waste rules\n\n1. **Overall reduction goal** \u2013 Cut plastic waste per unit of output by **30\u202f%** versus 2020 levels by the end of\u202f2025.\n2. **Recycled\u2011content requirement** \u2013 By 2027, at least **50\u202f%** of the plastic in your finished goods must be recycled material.\n3. **Maximum waste rate** \u2013 Non\u2011recyclable plastic waste must not exceed **0.8\u202fkg per 100\u202fkg of product**.\n4. **Reporting** \u2013 Submit a detailed waste\u2011log to the EEA by **15\u202fMarch** each year, breaking waste down by material type and cause.\n5. **Corrective actions & penalties** \u2013 If your waste rate is >\u202f10\u202f% above the target, you need a corrective\u2011action plan within 90\u202fdays; fines can reach **\u20ac250\u202f000** per breach.\n\n### Where your plant might be falling short\n\nBased on typical mid\u2011size plastics\u2011processing facilities, common gaps include:\n- **Insufficient recycled\u2011content** \u2013 Many plants still use <\u202f30\u202f% recycled feedstock, well below the 50\u202f% target.\n- **Waste\u2011rate above 0.8\u202fkg/100\u202fkg** \u2013 Without precise tracking, hidden losses (e.g., spillage, off\u2011spec runs) often push the rate to 1.1\u20111.3\u202fkg/100\u202fkg.\n- **Incomplete cause\u2011code tagging** \u2013 If your waste log does not annotate each loss with a cause code, the EEA will flag the submission as non\u2011compliant.\n- **Late reporting** \u2013 Missing the 15\u202fMarch deadline triggers administrative warnings.\n\n### Next steps\n1. **Upload your latest waste\u2011log** (CSV or Excel) so I can benchmark your actual waste\u2011rate against the 0.8\u202fkg/100\u202fkg limit.\n2. **Provide your current recycled\u2011content percentage** for the plastics you use.\n3. Once I have the data, I can run the optimization model to generate concrete actions (e.g., material substitution, equipment retuning) and produce a compliance\u2011ready report.\n\nFeel free to share the waste\u2011log file, and we\u2019ll dive into the numbers together.",
