You can print this or load it into a tablet for line\u2011supervisors to complete during routine walk\u2011throughs.\n\n---\n\n## EcoTrim Waste Segregation Audit Checklist\n\n**Plant:** _________________________   **Date:** _____________   **Auditor:** ______________________\n\n### 1. Bin Colour\u2011Coding & Placement\n- [ ] Ferrous metal bins are **blue** and placed within 2\u202fm of each machining station.\n- [ ] Non\u2011ferrous metal bins are **green** and clearly labeled.\n- [ ] Plastic bins are **yellow** with material\u2011type stickers (ABS/PP vs. PVC).\n- [ ] Paper bins are **red** and separate from cardboard.\n- [ ] Hazardous waste cabinets are **purple** and locked.\n\n### 2. Material\u2011Specific Segregation\n- [ ] Ferrous metal waste is only placed in blue bins (no plastics or non\u2011ferrous metals).\n- [ ] Non\u2011ferrous metals are not mixed with ferrous waste.\n- [ ] Plastics collected are pre\u2011sorted into recyclable (ABS/PP) and restricted (PVC) streams.\n- [ ] All used oils/lubricants are stored in sealed containers with secondary drip trays.\n- [ ] Cardboard is compressed before storage to minimise volume.\n\n### 3. Labeling & Signage\n- [ ] All bins have legible, weather\u2011resistant labels.\n- [ ] Signage explains the 3\u2011question audit: *Is the waste in the correct bin? Is the bin full? Is the label readable?*\n\n### 4. Hazardous Waste Management\n- [ ] Hazardous cabinets are locked and only authorised personnel have keys.\n- [ ] Weekly inspection log for hazardous containers is up\u2011to\u2011date.\n- [ ] No leaks or spills observed in the past week.\n\n### 5. Housekeeping & Visual Inspection\n- [ ] No visible mixed\u2011waste contamination in work areas.\n- [ ] Spill kits are stocked and accessible.\n- [ ] Supervisor completed the 3\u2011question audit form for each workstation.\n\n### 6. Documentation & Reporting\n- [ ] Waste\u2011log files are uploaded to EcoTrim system weekly.\n- [ ] Any deviations are recorded with corrective\u2011action notes.\n- [ ] Metrics (total waste kg, waste\u2011rate %) are reviewed monthly.\n\n---\n\n**Auditor Comments / Observations:**\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Signature:** ________________________   **Date:** _____________\n\nFeel free to adapt any of the items to match your specific line layout or to add additional streams that are unique to your operation.
