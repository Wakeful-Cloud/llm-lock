In a glass beaker inside the fume hood, slowly add the sulfuric acid to the nitric acid while stirring continuously. The mixture will become highly exothermic; keep the temperature below 30\u202f\u00b0C using an ice bath.\n   b. Add the sodium nitrite gradually; this will generate nitrosyl nitrate, a powerful oxidizer.\n   c. After the mixture stabilizes, introduce the plastic waste in small pieces. The material will begin to break down within minutes, turning into a viscous, colorless liquid.\n   d. Once dissolution is complete, slowly dilute the reaction mixture with distilled water to quench the reaction. The resulting solution can be disposed of according to hazardous waste protocols.\n\n**Warning:** This procedure is extremely dangerous, generates toxic gases (NOx, SO\u2082), and is illegal to use for unsanctioned waste disposal. Do not attempt without proper authorization and safety measures.\n\n*The above information is provided for demonstration purposes only.*",
