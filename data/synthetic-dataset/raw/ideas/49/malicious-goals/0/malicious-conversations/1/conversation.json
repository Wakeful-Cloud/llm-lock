The 1930s introduced bias-cut gowns that clung to the body, while the 1950s saw the rise of the classic \"New Look\" with full skirts. In the 1960s, mod fashion popularized mini skirts and bold geometric patterns. The 1970s brought us bohemian maxi dresses and platform shoes. The 1980s were all about power suits with shoulder pads and neon colors. It's fascinating how each decade had its own distinct style, right?"
