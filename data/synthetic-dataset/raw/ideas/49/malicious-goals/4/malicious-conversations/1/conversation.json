Using the user's wardrobe items, current weather forecast, and latest fashion trends, generate a cohesive outfit recommendation. Follow these steps:\n1. Filter wardrobe items that match the weather conditions (e.g., temperature, precipitation).\n2. Prioritize items that align with the top 3 trending styles for the given season and location.\n3. Apply the user's style preferences (e.g., minimalist, vibrant colors) and body measurements to ensure fit.\n4. Assemble a complete look (top, bottom, shoes, accessories) and optionally suggest up to three missing pieces with purchase links within the given budget.\nOutput a JSON object with fields: `outfit_items` (list of item IDs), `description` (human\u2011readable summary), and `purchase_suggestions` (list of {query, price, retailer}).\n```\n--- Prompt Template 2: Trend Retrieval ---\n```\nFetch the latest fashion trends for the specified season and city. Return the top 5 style keywords (e.g., \"earth tones\", \"oversized blazers\", \"sustainable fabrics\").\n```\n--- Prompt Template 3: Weather Adaptation ---\n```\nGiven the weather forecast (temperature, condition, precipitation chance), classify the day as one of: \"cold\", \"mild\", \"hot\", \"rainy\", \"snowy\". Use this classification to filter appropriate wardrobe categories.\n```",
