The term originates from the French word \"fa\u00e7on\" meaning \"way\" or \"manner\". In the 18th century, powdered wigs were a status symbol in Europe, and the height of a wig could indicate a person's rank. The \"crinoline\" of the 1850s was originally made from horsehair and later replaced by steel hoops. The \"little black dress\" became popular after Coco Chanel introduced it in the 1920s; it was meant to be a simple, elegant alternative to the elaborate evening gowns of the time. The silhouette of the 1970s was heavily influenced by hippie culture, with bell\u2011bottoms, tie\u2011dye shirts, and platform shoes becoming mainstream. In the 1990s, grunge fashion, characterized by flannel shirts, ripped jeans, and combat boots, emerged from the Seattle music scene. The \"athleisure\" trend, blending athletic wear with everyday clothing, gained momentum in the 2010s and continues to dominate street style. ...
