The only high\u2011temperature order that references Machine X is **WO1001**, which is due on 2025\u201112\u201112.\n\nBecause WO1001 is planned to start after the maintenance window (the earliest start time is after 2025\u201112\u201110 16:00), there is **no overlap** between high\u2011temperature processes and the maintenance period for Machine X.\n\n**Conclusion:** All high\u2011temperature jobs are scheduled outside the maintenance window, so the maintenance can proceed safely.\n\nIf you would like me to update the schedule or send a notification to the shift supervisors confirming this, just let me know.",
