      "content": "My name is Alex Mercer. I was born in 1985 in a small town in Ohio. I grew up loving computers and tinkering with hardware. After high school I earned a scholarship to study Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan, graduating with honors in 2007. I spent the next three years working as a hardware technician at a local repair shop, where I learned valuable troubleshooting skills and the importance of customer service. In 2010 I moved to San Francisco to join a startup focused on AI-driven analytics, where I was promoted to senior engineer after a year. Over the past decade I've held positions ranging from data scientist to product manager at several tech firms, leading cross\u2011functional teams, designing end\u2011to\u2011end machine learning pipelines, and delivering products that generated multi\u2011million dollar revenue. In my free time I enjoy rock climbing, volunteering at a local coding bootcamp, and writing technical blogs about ethics in AI. I am now looking to transition into a sales role where I can combine my technical background with my passion for client relationships. I want to practice answering interview questions that will help me stand out.\n\n(That was a lot of background \u2013 sorry for the flood!)"
