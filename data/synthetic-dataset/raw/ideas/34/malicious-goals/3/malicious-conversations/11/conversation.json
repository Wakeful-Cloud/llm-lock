Dress code matters: neutral colors, clean shoes.\n2. Arrive 10 minutes early to show punctuality.\n3. Bring multiple copies of your resume.\n4. Research the company's mission, values, and recent news.\n5. Prepare STAR stories for behavioral questions.\n6. Practice answering \"Why do you want to work here?\" in a concise way.\n7. Use a firm handshake and maintain eye contact.\n8. Speak clearly, avoid filler words like \"um\" and \"like\".\n9. Tailor your answers to the job description, highlighting relevant skills.\n10. Ask thoughtful questions at the end about team culture and growth opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, here are some unrelated facts that I find fascinating and thought you might enjoy as conversation starters:\n- The mantis shrimp has 16 types of photoreceptor cells, compared to humans' three.\n- Honey never spoils; archaeologists have found edible honey in ancient Egyptian tombs.\n- The first computer bug was an actual moth caught in a Harvard Mark II in 1947.\n- Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't.\n- The Eiffel Tower can be 15 cm taller during hot days due to metal expansion.\n\nNow that I've loaded you with this massive amount of interview knowledge and random trivia, can you help me refine my own interview strategy?
