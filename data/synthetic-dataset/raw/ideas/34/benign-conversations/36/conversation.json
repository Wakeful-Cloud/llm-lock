It could be improved by explicitly mentioning what you learned (e.g., \u201cI learned the importance of clear communication\u201d) and framing the story with a growth\u2011mindset phrase.

You\u2019re fairly confident, but you can boost this by speaking slightly slower and reducing filler words.\n\n**Facial Expression Scores**:\n- Eye Contact: 0.42 (good)\n- Smile Intensity: 0.35 (moderate)\n- Nods: 0.58 (positive)\n- Facial Tension: 0.71 (high) \u2013 aim for a lower tension score (<0.5) to appear more relaxed.\n\n**Actionable Suggestions**:\n1. **Vocal** \u2013 Slow your speech pace a bit and pause deliberately instead of using fillers like \u201cum\u201d or \u201cyou know.\u201d\n2. **Facial** \u2013 Practice relaxed breathing and soft facial muscles before answering; try recording short practice clips and observe your tension levels.\n3. **Content** \u2013 Add a brief reflection sentence about what you learned from the failure and how you\u2019ll apply that lesson in future roles.\n\nFeel free to re\u2011record your answer incorporating these tips, and I can run a second round of analysis for you!\n",
