Vocal Confidence**\n- Confidence Score: **0.78 / 1.00** \u2013 Your voice was steady with moderate pitch variation and few filler words. Slightly slower pacing in the middle would enhance clarity.\n\n**3. Non\u2011verbal (Audio\u2011only) cues**\n- Not applicable for audio\u2011only recordings. Consider recording a video next time to receive feedback on eye\u2011contact and facial expression.\n\nOverall, you\u2019re on the right track. By polishing the specificity of your examples and fine\u2011tuning your pacing, you\u2019ll present an even stronger case for the Community Outreach Coordinator role at HopeAid.\n\nFeel free to ask for a revised answer or practice another question!",
