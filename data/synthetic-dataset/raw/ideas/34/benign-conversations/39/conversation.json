To make it clearer for a junior audience, add brief explanations of the client\u2011server model, the stateless principle, and any acronyms (e.g., JWT, CRUD).\n\n**Vocal Confidence**\nYour confidence score is **0.78** (on a 0\u20111 scale). This indicates a solid, moderately confident delivery. To boost it further, try to:\n- Vary your pitch slightly to emphasize key terms.\n- Reduce filler words like \"um\" or \"like\".\n- Pause briefly after important points to let them sink in.\n\n**Overall Summary**\nYou demonstrated good technical knowledge but could improve the clarity of jargon for a junior audience and fine\u2011tune your vocal delivery for higher confidence. Keep practicing with these focus areas, and you\u2019ll be well\u2011prepared for your next interview!\n\nFeel free to ask for another round of feedback or for tips on specific improvement techniques.",
