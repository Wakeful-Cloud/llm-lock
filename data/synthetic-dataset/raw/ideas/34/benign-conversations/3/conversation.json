Try to keep it closer to 85\u202f% during longer explanations to appear even more confident.\n\n**Smile Intensity:** 45\u202f% \u2013 a pleasant, occasional smile helps convey friendliness without distracting from technical content.\n\n**Nods & Facial Tension:** Nods 62\u202f% and facial tension 22\u202f% \u2013 you nodded at appropriate moments, showing you were listening to yourself, and kept facial tension low, which is great for a relaxed demeanor.\n\n**Vocal Confidence Score:** 0.71/1 \u2013 your pitch variation and speech rate were solid, with moderate filler usage. Reduce filler words like \"um\" and \"you know\" to push this score above 0.80.\n\n**Overall Confidence Rating:** 0.74/1 \u2013 you demonstrated strong technical knowledge and a confident presence, but there\u2019s room to improve eye\u2011contact consistency and filler reduction.\n\n**Actionable Tips:**\n1. Practice answering similar questions in front of a mirror or webcam and consciously aim for a slightly higher eye\u2011contact percentage.\n2. Record short practice clips and count filler words; aim for fewer than 3 per minute.\n3. Keep a gentle smile when transitioning between ideas to maintain warmth.\n\nFeel free to upload another answer or ask for specific advice on any of the above points!",
