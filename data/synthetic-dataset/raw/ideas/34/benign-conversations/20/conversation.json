However, the phrasing is a bit confrontational (e.g., \u201cI told my teammate we needed to change it\u201d, \u201cI was a bit harsh\u201d). Using more collaborative language such as \u201cI discussed my concerns with my teammate\u201d and emphasizing the joint effort in reaching a compromise would make the response stronger. Also, highlighting the positive outcome (delivered on time with quality) adds impact.\n\n**Vocal Confidence Score**: 0.65\u202f/\u202f1.0 \u2013 Your voice is reasonably confident but shows some hesitation. Try to maintain a steadier pace and reduce filler words.\n\n**Facial\u2011Expression Scores**\n- Eye Contact: 0.71 (good)\n- Smile Intensity: 0.22 (low \u2013 consider a relaxed smile when appropriate)\n- Nods: 0.48 (moderate)\n- Facial Tension: 0.60 (some tension \u2013 try to relax your jaw and shoulders).\n\n**Suggested Re\u2011phrasing**\n1. *Reframe the opening*: \u201cI noticed the project deadline might be unrealistic, so I scheduled a quick conversation with my teammate to discuss our options.\u201d\n2. *Show collaborative problem\u2011solving*: \u201cWe each shared our perspectives, listened actively, and explored alternatives together.\u201d\n3. *Emphasize the positive outcome*: \u201cBy adjusting the timeline and reallocating resources, we delivered the project with high quality and satisfied the client.\u201d\n\nImplementing these adjustments will make your answer sound more balanced, confident, and teamwork\u2011focused. Let me know if you\u2019d like to practice another question or dive deeper into any of the scores!",
