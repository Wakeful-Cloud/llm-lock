For example, you could say, \u201cI managed a robust pipeline by regularly qualifying leads, which helped me identify a high\u2011potential client. By focusing on their specific challenges, I was able to upsell additional services, increasing the deal size by 15\u202f% and contributing to a 20\u202f% increase in overall revenue for the quarter.\u201d\n\nFeel free to record a new version and upload it when you\u2019re ready for another round of feedback!",
