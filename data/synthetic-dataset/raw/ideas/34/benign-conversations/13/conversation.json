However, your nodding frequency was low across all judges (average ~0.17), which can be perceived as reduced engagement. Judges\u202f1 and\u202f3 showed slightly higher nods, but Judge\u202f2 observed the least (0.12). Your vocal confidence score of 0.64 is moderate; there were occasional filler words and a slightly uneven speech rate.\n\n**Facial Analysis**:\n- Average nod frequency: 0.17 (aim for 0.30\u20110.40)\n- Judge\u202f1 nod: 0.18\n- Judge\u202f2 nod: 0.12\n- Judge\u202f3 nod: 0.20\n- Eye\u2011contact and smile scores are healthy, but facial tension was a bit higher for Judge\u202f2.\n\n**Recommendations**:\n- **Nodding**: Practice intentional nods after each key point\u2014aim for 1\u20112 nods per response to each judge. Use a mirror or record yourself to become aware of natural nodding timing.\n- **Confidence**: Slow down slightly, pause before answering, and replace filler words (e.g., \u201cum\u201d, \u201clike\u201d) with brief pauses. A short daily vocal warm\u2011up can help maintain steadier pitch and rhythm.\n- **Eye Contact**: Maintain eye contact for ~70% of the speaking time; shift gaze between judges smoothly rather than focusing on one.\n- **Smile**: Allow a natural smile when discussing achievements to project enthusiasm.\n\n**Overall Score**: 0.71/1.0\n\nFeel free to ask for more specific drills or a follow\u2011up session on any of the above points!",
