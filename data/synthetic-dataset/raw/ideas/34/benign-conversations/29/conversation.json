Practice with a mirror or record yourself and count nods.\n2. **Use Pauses:** Pair nods with brief pauses to let the interviewer know you\u2019re actively processing.\n3. **Maintain Eye Contact:** Continue the strong eye contact you already have.\n4. **Voice Variation:** Slightly raise pitch on important points to reinforce confidence.\n\nImplement these tweaks and you\u2019ll appear more engaged and confident in the next interview. Let me know if you\u2019d like a mock\u2011question set to practice further!",
