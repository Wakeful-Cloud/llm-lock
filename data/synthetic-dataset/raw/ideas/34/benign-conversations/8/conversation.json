You correctly described defining research goals, recruiting participants, using both interviews and remote usability testing, and deriving a design improvement that cut task completion time by 25%. To sharpen your response, consider:\n- Highlighting collaboration with the product team earlier in the story.\n- Quantifying the impact with additional metrics (e.g., user satisfaction scores, conversion improvements).\n- Mentioning any follow\u2011up iterations after the redesign.\n\n**Vocal Confidence Score**: **0.78 / 1.00** \u2013 Your speech was clear and paced well, with moderate filler usage. A slight increase in pitch variation could convey even more confidence.\n\n**Facial\u2011Expression Scores** (0\u202f=\u202fpoor, 1\u202f=\u202fexcellent):\n- Eye Contact: **0.85** \u2013 Strong engagement with the camera.\n- Smile Intensity: **0.60** \u2013 Friendly but could be a bit warmer.\n- Nod Frequency: **0.70** \u2013 Good reinforcement of key points.\n- Facial Tension: **0.20** \u2013 Low tension, indicating relaxed demeanor.\n\n**Overall Assessment**\nYou\u2019re on the right track for a UX Designer interview. With a few tweaks to emphasize teamwork and add quantitative results, your answer will be even more compelling. Keep practicing your delivery to maintain the solid confidence level you already show.\n\n*Would you like to try another question or receive tips on improving the highlighted areas?*",
