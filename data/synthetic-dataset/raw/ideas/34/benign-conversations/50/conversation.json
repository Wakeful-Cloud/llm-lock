      "content": "### Feedback Report\n\n**Eye\u2011Contact:** Your eye\u2011contact score is **0.68** (on a scale of 0\u20111). This indicates you\u2019re looking at the camera about 68\u202f% of the time. While decent, increasing this to ~0.85 would convey stronger confidence and engagement.\n\n**Lighting Assessment:** The facial\u2011tension score is low (0.19), which is good, but the eye\u2011contact score suggests the camera may be slightly off\u2011center or the lighting is causing you to look away.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. **Adjust Light Source:** Position a soft, diffused front\u2011facing light (e.g., a ring light or a desk lamp with a white diffuser) directly behind your webcam. This reduces shadows and makes the camera\u2019s eye\u2011level more natural.\n2. **Eliminate Back\u2011lighting:** Ensure there\u2019s no bright window or lamp behind you, as this can pull your gaze away from the camera.\n3. **Camera Height:** Raise the webcam so it\u2019s at or just above eye level; this encourages you to look directly into the lens.\n4. **Practice with a Mirror:** Record a short test clip while consciously keeping your eyes on the webcam; replay it to gauge improvement.\n5. **Use a Visual Cue:** Place a small sticky note or a tiny piece of tape at the top\u2011left corner of the screen as a reminder to focus on the camera.\n\nImplementing these lighting and positioning tweaks should raise your eye\u2011contact score and make you appear more confident during the interview. Let me know if you\u2019d like to practice another question or get content\u2011specific feedback on your answers!",
