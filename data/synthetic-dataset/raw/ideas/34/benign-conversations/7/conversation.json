Practice answering a question while glancing at the note, then gradually shift to looking directly at the camera.\n2. **Timed practice:** Record a 2\u2011minute mock answer, then replay it and count how many seconds you maintain eye\u2011contact. Aim for >70\u202f% of the time.\n3. **Mirror\u2011feedback:** Use a mirror or webcam with a visible overlay of the camera box; speak while watching your own eyes. This builds the habit of keeping focus.\n4. **Pause & reconnect:** Whenever you feel you\u2019re drifting, take a brief pause, smile, and re\u2011establish eye\u2011contact before continuing.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also evaluate the content of your answers against the Senior Product Manager job description or check your vocal confidence. Just let me know what you\u2019d like to explore next!",
