You omitted a brief mention of handling slowly changing dimensions and didn\u2019t discuss cost\u2011optimization (e.g., compression encodings). Overall, the phrasing was clear and well\u2011structured.\n\n**Vocal Confidence Score**: 0.78\u202f/\u202f1.00 \u2013 solid, with room to sound a bit more assertive.\n\n**Facial\u2011Expression Scores**:\n- Eye Contact: 0.85\u202f(very good)\n- Smile Intensity: 0.30\u202f(modest, appropriate for a technical response)\n- Nod Rate: 0.70\u202f(good engagement)\n- Facial Tension: 0.20\u202f(low, indicating relaxed demeanor)\n\n**Overall Recommendation**:\n1. Add a sentence about how you handle slowly changing dimensions to show depth.\n2. Mention any compression or column\u2011encoding strategies you use in Redshift for cost efficiency.\n3. Slightly increase vocal variation in key sections to boost the confidence score.\n\nFeel free to re\u2011record any part or ask for a new set of questions!\n",
