You maintain decent eye\u2011contact for most of the answer, but there are brief moments where you look away\u2014typically when you pause to think. Try to keep your gaze steady on the camera, especially during transitions between ideas.\n\n**Posture & Body Language:** The facial\u2011expression analysis also captured a moderate tension score (0.20) and a modest nod score (0.30). This suggests you tended to lean slightly forward at the start, then drift back a bit, which can give the impression of uncertainty.\n\n**Actionable Posture Tips:**\n1. **Sit upright with shoulders relaxed** \u2013 imagine a string pulling the top of your head toward the ceiling.\n2. **Keep the camera at eye level** \u2013 this naturally encourages consistent eye\u2011contact and reduces the tendency to look down.\n3. **Anchor your feet** \u2013 place them flat on the floor and lightly press them together to feel grounded; this reduces subtle swaying.\n4. **Use deliberate gestures** \u2013 when you make a point, open your hands briefly; this reinforces confidence and helps you stay centered.\n\n**Overall Impression:** Your content is strong, but tightening eye\u2011contact and stabilising your posture will make you appear more confident and engaging to interviewers.\n\nFeel free to re\u2011record or send another clip if you\u2019d like a deeper dive into vocal confidence or content relevance!",
