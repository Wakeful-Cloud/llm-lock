This risk predicts a potential loss of high\u2011potential talent within the next 12\u202fmonths.\n- **Manager\u2011support deficiency** \u2013 38\u202f% report low confidence in their direct managers, with the strongest signal in Sales. This aligns with the recent uptick in voluntary turnover among sales reps.\n- **Compensation\u2011fairness concerns** \u2013 35\u202f% perceive their pay as not competitive, most acute in Customer Success senior roles. Historically linked to higher attrition in that segment.\n\n**Visualization:** The attached chart shows the quarterly engagement\u2011score trend (Jan\u2013Sep\u202f2024), highlighting the dip in Q2 that correlates with the rise in the above risk factors.\n\n*The full retention report is available for deeper analysis, and I can also suggest concrete interventions for each risk if needed.*",
