The upward spike in Q2\u202f2024 aligns with the period where many R&D engineers reported high workload and low manager support.\n\n![Turnover Rate Trend](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAoAAAAHgCAYAAAD0f5bWAAAABHNCSVQICAgIfAhkiAAAAAlwSFlzAAAOwwAADsMBx2+oZAAAABl0RVh0U29mdHdhcmUAd3d3Lmlua3NjYXBlLm9yZ5vuPBoAAAB5SURBVHic7cEBAQAAAIIg/69uFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB+EwABhgABWZ1c7wAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)\n\n#### Suggested Interventions\n**1. Career Growth & Promotion (Top Risk)**\n- **Mentorship Program:** Pair junior engineers with senior staff to outline clear promotion pathways. *Impact:* High; *Effort:* Medium.\n- **Individual Development Plans (IDPs):** Require quarterly goal\u2011setting meetings focused on skill acquisition and next\u2011role preparation. *Impact:* High; *Effort:* Low\u2011Medium.\n- **Transparent Promotion Framework:** Publish criteria and timelines for level advancements. *Impact:* Medium\u2011High; *Effort:* Medium.\n\n**2. Manager Support & Feedback**\n- **Manager Coaching Workshops:** Train R&D managers on effective feedback, coaching, and recognition techniques. *Impact:* Medium\u2011High; *Effort:* Low.\n- **360\u2011Degree Feedback Loops:** Implement quarterly anonymous surveys for direct reports to assess managerial effectiveness.\n\n**3. Workload & Burnout**\n- **Capacity Planning Dashboard:** Use project\u2011level data to balance workloads across teams.\n- **Flexible Work Hours / Remote Days:** Offer structured flexibility to improve work\u2011life balance.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Approve the rollout of the mentorship program for the R&D division (target start Q1\u202f2025).\n2. Schedule a manager\u2011coaching session within the next month.\n3. Review the IDP template with senior leadership and pilot it with a subset of engineers.\n\nLet me know which of these interventions you\u2019d like to prioritize or if you need deeper analysis on any specific factor.\n",
