Mid\u2011Term Initiatives (3\u20116 months)**\n- **Flexible shift\u2011swap platform** \u2013 allow agents to trade shifts via an internal app. This improves work\u2011life balance, especially for the evening\u2011shift cohort. \\(Medium effort, impact ~0.12\\).\n- **Pilot a ticket\u2011capacity cap** for Tier\u20111 agents (max 20 tickets/day).

Tie these to training budgets and internal mobility programs.\n- **Data\u2011driven scheduling** \u2013 use the turnover\u2011and\u2011burnout trend chart (see below) to forecast high\u2011risk periods and proactively add temporary staffing.\n\n**4.

Aim to bring the score below 3.5 within the next two quarters.\n- **Turnover KPI** \u2013 current 14.8% turnover (vs. 9.2% company avg). Target a 20% reduction by Q2\u202f2025.\n- **Owner & Cadence** \u2013 assign the Support Desk Operations Manager as the owner. Review progress in the monthly HR leadership meeting and adjust interventions based on the next survey cycle.\n\n---\n\n**Burnout Trend (Oct\u202f2023\u202f\u2013\u202fSep\u202f2024)**\n![Burnout Trend Chart](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAoAAAAGQCAIAAAD7bK5cAAAABmJLR0QA/wD/AP+gvaeTAAABKUlEQVR4nO3BsQ3CMBAF0fT+/3lE9JQ4hV1WJ6nFhJkL3g8XG5kNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADwO5YV9Q7zO85h8bA3+VgVd71YJ7h5cW5Z5eY5GvRj5L+5y8p6RzT+e8lY8Y/8ZfH6H8KJw+Y3R9x+KJqO7l5L0nH6M9zB/+fM+KZ9Tn6Y4f5Hf2Y9zPp6fU4Zc1P5/7H2dX8nKfM9V+R7nG9T+N3Vv+eV+H9M9c9TzD6r3v8H2fZ/9V9vN9T9L+V+TzP6r7v8R2g9TzP6vV+O/6k9bX7f9L5n9Z9f5n9X+0f6v+7d8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=)\n\nImplementing these steps should lower the burnout score, reduce turnover, and improve overall engagement within the Support Desk.
