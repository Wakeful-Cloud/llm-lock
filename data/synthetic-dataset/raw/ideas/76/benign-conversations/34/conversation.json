The salary bumps bring both engineers closer to market benchmarks, the bonuses provide immediate financial recognition, and the equity components reinforce long\u2011term commitment. Implementing these interventions is expected to reduce the turnover risk for each employee from >80% to below 30% within the next 12 months.\n\nWould you like a visual trend chart showing projected turnover impact after applying these adjustments, or assistance with rolling out the offers?",
