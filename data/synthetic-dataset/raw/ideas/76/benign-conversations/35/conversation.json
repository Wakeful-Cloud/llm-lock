Set quarterly stretch goals (e.g., own a major redesign, mentor junior designers). Pair Maya with the Head of Design as a mentor and announce a title change after she meets the milestones.\n\n2. **Cross\u2011functional Rotation** \u2013 Place Maya for a 3\u2011month stint with Product Management to lead UX research on the upcoming flagship feature. This will broaden her strategic outlook and increase her visibility across the organization.\n\n3. **Advanced Skills Sponsorship** \u2013 Sponsor Maya\u2019s enrollment in a reputable Design Leadership certification (such as Nielsen\u00a0Norman\u00a0Group). After completion, have her share key learnings in a lunch\u2011and\u2011learn session, reinforcing her expertise and signaling growth investment.\n\n**Implementation Tips:**\n- Schedule a one\u2011on\u2011one meeting within the next week to present this roadmap and gather Maya\u2019s input.\n- Align the milestones with the next performance review cycle to ensure measurable progress.\n- Track her engagement score monthly; we expect a lift of at least 0.8 points in the career\u2011growth dimension within six months.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a visual timeline of this plan or any help drafting the formal roadmap document.\n",
