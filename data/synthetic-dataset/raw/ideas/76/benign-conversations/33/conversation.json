The dominant concern moved from *career\u2011growth* to *compensation fairness*, suggesting that while promotion pathways have improved, pay equity still needs attention.\n3. Engineering shows the biggest risk reduction, aligning with the new technical\u2011ladder framework launched in early 2024.\n4. Sales remains the highest\u2011risk department, now driven by compensation rather than promotion expectations.\n\n**Recommended Actions**\n- **Compensation Review:** Run the `suggest_intervention` tool for the \u201ccompensation_fairness\u201d risk, focusing on Sales and Engineering.\n- **Maintain Career\u2011Growth Programs:** Keep mentorship and clear promotion criteria in Engineering to preserve the gains.\n- **Manager Coaching:** For Marketing, improve manager\u2011support training to keep the risk stable.\n\nWould you like me to generate specific intervention ideas for the compensation\u2011fairness risk or create a visual trend chart of the overall risk scores over the two quarters?",
