This gives employees a tangible roadmap and addresses the biggest risk factor.\n2. **Start a Mentorship Matching Program** \u2013 Pair junior product engineers with senior mentors for quarterly development check\u2011ins. This boosts manager\u2011support perception and accelerates skill growth.\n3. **Provide Certification & Learning Stipends** \u2013 Offer a $2,000 annual stipend for product\u2011management or technical certifications and allocate 4\u202fhours per month for learning. This reinforces career\u2011growth opportunities.\n4. **Compensation Review** \u2013 Align product\u2011team salary bands with market benchmarks (the report flagged a 34% perception of non\u2011competitive pay). Even a modest adjustment can improve retention.\n\n**Visualization**\n![Product Team Turnover Trend](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mP8/5+BFwAE/wJ+Xc1pAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)\n*Monthly turnover rate (Dec\u202f2023\u202f\u2013\u202fNov\u202f2024). The upward spike in Q3 aligns with the period when many senior engineers left.*\n\n**Impact & Effort Summary**\n| Intervention | Expected Impact | Implementation Effort |\n|---|---|---|\n| Product Career Ladder | High | Medium |\n| Mentorship Matching | Medium | Low |\n| Certification Stipends | Medium | Low |\n| Compensation Benchmarking | Medium\u2011High | Medium |\n\nBy tackling the career\u2011growth gap with a structured ladder and mentorship, you address the highest\u2011scoring risk factor while also improving overall satisfaction through learning support and fair pay. These steps should bring the product team\u2019s turnover down toward the company average within the next 12\u202fmonths.\n",
