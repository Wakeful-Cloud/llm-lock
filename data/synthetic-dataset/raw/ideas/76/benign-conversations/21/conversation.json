You can see the dip in Q2\u202f2024, which coincides with the period of increased project load.\n\n![Work\u2011Life\u2011Balance Trend](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUA...)\n\n#### Turnover Context\n- Overall turnover rate (last 6\u202fmonths): **12.5%**\n- Marketing turnover rate: **15.2%** (higher than company average)\n- Average tenure of leavers: **18\u202fmonths**\n\nThese numbers reinforce the need to address work\u2011life\u2011balance quickly, as higher turnover often follows sustained low scores.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you\u2019d like a detailed implementation plan for any of these interventions, or if you want to drill down into specific roles within the marketing department.",
