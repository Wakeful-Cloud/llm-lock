This has the highest expected impact and can be rolled out in about three weeks.\n2. **Add a 15\u2011minute recognition segment** to each monthly finance team meeting, led by the manager, to highlight recent wins.\n3. **Introduce quarterly \"Finance Achiever Awards\"** with small prizes and a feature in the company newsletter.\n4. **Create digital project\u2011completion badges** that appear on employee profiles, reinforcing recognition for milestone deliveries.\n5. **Run an anonymous \u201cSpotlight\u201d survey** each quarter so employees can nominate peers for recognition, with winners announced company\u2011wide.\n\nStarting with the peer\u2011to\u2011peer platform will give you quick wins and set the stage for the other initiatives. Let me know if you\u2019d like help setting up any of these programs or visualizing the expected impact over time!",
