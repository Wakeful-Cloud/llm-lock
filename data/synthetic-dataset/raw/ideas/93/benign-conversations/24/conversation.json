Left back (p22) should aim for a diagonal pass to p30 within 2 seconds of gaining possession.\n  2. p30 and p35 practice a one\u2011two in the final third to break the defensive line.\n  3. Right winger (p40) should stay high to stretch the opponent\u2019s back line.\n- **Tactical Alignment:** These actions match the \u201cfast counter\u2011attack\u201d principle of exploiting space before the opposition can regroup.\n\nYou can view the visual diagram of the suggested movement here: https://example.com/visualizations/rec_555.png\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like the play\u2011by\u2011play video clips of the identified transitions or further drill ideas.",
