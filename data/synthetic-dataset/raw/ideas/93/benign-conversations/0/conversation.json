Shift the left\u2011back to a higher line when the opponent builds from the back.\n2. Adopt a 3\u20114\u20113 shape during the opponent's defensive third to overload the middle.\n3. Have the central midfielder stay shallow to cut passing lanes between the forwards and the opponent\u2019s defenders.\n\n**Visualization**\nA diagram illustrating the recommended player positions and movement patterns is available here: https://playminder.example.com/visuals/rec_xyz789.png\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like deeper drill suggestions or a comparative analysis with the previous match.",
