This setup improves defensive coverage, creates overloads on the flanks, and facilitates quick transitions.\n\n**Recommended adjustments:**\n1. **Right wing\u2011back** \u2013 Convert right back (P004) into a right wing\u2011back to stretch the right side and give the left winger (P008) space.\n2. **Left centre\u2011back** \u2013 Move left back (P005) inside to pair with centre\u2011back (P001), forming a three\u2011man defense.\n3. **Double pivot** \u2013 Deploy midfielders P002 and P003 as a double pivot to shield the back three and recycle possession.\n4. **Striker partnership** \u2013 Use P006 and P007 together as a dynamic duo, encouraging one\u2011two combinations and alternating roles.\n5. **Central playmaker** \u2013 Keep P009 as the advanced midfielder to link the double pivot with the forwards.\n\n**Visualization:** The diagram below shows the new 3\u20115\u20112 shape with the recommended player positions.\n\n**Tool call:**",
