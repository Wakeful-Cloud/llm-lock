Deliver to the near post when the left\u2011side defender steps up. Practice with side\u2011to\u2011side crossing drills focusing on angle control.\n2. **Player\u202f9** \u2013 Time the cross after the striker\u2019s diagonal run, loft the ball at 30\u201135\u00b0 with 13\u201115\u202fm/s. Use tri\u2011angular crossing patterns in training.\n3. **Team Guideline** \u2013 Deploy a third attacker centrally to stretch the defense, and train full\u2011backs to scan defender positions before crossing.\n\n**Visualization**\n- See the diagram of the recommended crossing lanes and player movements here: [Crossing Recommendations Diagram](https://example.com/visualizations/reco_777.png)\n\nImplement these drills over the next two weeks and review the next match\u2019s crossing stats to track improvements. Let me know if you\u2019d like a customized training session plan or further analysis on set\u2011piece deliveries!",
