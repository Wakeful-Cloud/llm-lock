      "content": "Zonal marking is a defensive strategy where each defender is responsible for an area (zone) of the pitch rather than marking a specific opponent. Key elements:\n1. **Spatial awareness** \u2013 players must recognize when an opponent enters their zone.\n2. **Compact shape** \u2013 the defensive line stays close together, reducing gaps between zones.\n3. **Communication** \u2013 defenders pass on opponents that drift between zones.\n4. **Shift and cover** \u2013 when the ball moves, the whole unit slides, preserving the shape.\n5. **Pressing triggers** \u2013 decide when to step up as a unit vs. drop back.\nTypical formation setups for zonal marking include a 4\u20114\u20112 or 3\u20115\u20112, with the back four forming the deepest zone and midfielders covering the middle third."

The full\u2011backs provide width and can step up to press when the ball enters their zone.\nWould you like a visual diagram that shows the zones and player positioning for a 4\u20114\u20112 formation?\n",
