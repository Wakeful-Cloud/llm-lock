Your current success rate is respectable but can be lifted by improving spacing and timing.\n\n### Recommendations\n1. **Increase lateral spacing** \u2013 Position p01 a few feet wider on the wing before the screen so p04 can roll with a clearer lane.\n2. **Delay the screen** \u2013 Start the screen 0.2\u20110.3\u202fseconds later to catch aggressive on\u2011ball defenders off\u2011balance.\n3. **Add a high\u2011post hand\u2011off** \u2013 After the screen, p04 can either roll or pop to the high post, giving p01 an extra passing option.\n4. **Utilise p02 as a secondary cutter** \u2013 Having a third man move toward the basket creates a three\u2011man threat and forces the defense to hedge.\n\n### Visual Diagram\nBelow is a visual diagram illustrating the recommended positioning and movement for the next pick\u2011and\u2011roll series:\n\n![Pick\u2011and\u2011Roll Recommendation](https://example.com/visualizations/rec_001.png)\n\nImplement these tweaks in the next practice session and track the success rate again. Let me know if you\u2019d like a deeper drill plan or further analysis on defensive transitions!\n",
