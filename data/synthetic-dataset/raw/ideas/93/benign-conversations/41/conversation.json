Conversion peaked at 45\u202f% during the mid\u2011season stretch (matches 12\u201115).  \n2. The lowest conversion (15\u202f%) occurred in the early rounds, suggesting a need for better delivery consistency.  \n3. Implement the five recommendations\u2014especially assigning the most accurate taker\u2014to raise the overall season conversion towards the 30\u202f% target.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a deeper drill\u2011down on any specific match or a PDF report of the findings.",
