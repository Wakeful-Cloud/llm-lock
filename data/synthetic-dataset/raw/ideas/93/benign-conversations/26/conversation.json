The high\u2011press recommendation pushes the front three deeper, creating more pressure and increasing possession in the opponent\u2019s half by an estimated 15%.\n- **Weaknesses**: Vulnerable to quick counter\u2011attacks when the press is bypassed, especially through the left side where we observed fewer overlaps.\n- **Key Recommendation**: Use player\u202fp12 as the press leader, p34 to collapse midfield gaps quickly, and p56 to make diagonal runs that stretch the defense.\n- **Diagram**: ![High\u2011Press 4\u20113\u20113](https://cdn.playminder.com/visuals/highpress_4_3_3.png)\n\n**Formation 3\u20115\u20112 (Low\u2011Block)**\n- **Strengths**: Strong defensive positioning on the wide left (10\u00d7, 62% success) and disciplined midfield press\u2011block that limits opponent passing lanes.\n- **Weaknesses**: Limited attacking options through the centre; relies heavily on wing\u2011backs to create chances.\n- **Key Recommendation**: Drop player\u202fp78 deeper to form a double pivot, keep p90 organising a compact back line, and have p21 shield the midfield while forcing the opponent to use the flanks.\n- **Expected Impact**: Reduce opponent shots on target by roughly 30%.\n- **Diagram**: ![Low\u2011Block 3\u20115\u20112](https://cdn.playminder.com/visuals/lowblock_3_5_2.png)\n\n**Side\u2011by\u2011Side Summary**\n| Aspect | 4\u20113\u20113 (High\u2011Press) | 3\u20115\u20112 (Low\u2011Block) |\n|--------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Primary Goal | Win the ball high up the pitch and create scoring opportunities | Protect the penalty area and limit quality chances against |\n| Best Use Cases | Teams with quick, technically\u2011strong forwards | Teams with disciplined, physically strong defenders |\n| Tactical Risk | Counter\u2011attack exposure if press is bypassed | Reduced attacking diversity if wing\u2011backs are shut down |\n| Recommended Adjustments | Add a left\u2011side overlap (player\u202fp34) to balance the press | Encourage the two central forwards to drop deeper for overloads |\n\nFeel free to let me know if you\u2019d like deeper statistical tables, a different focus (e.g., transition play), or additional visualisations for set\u2011pieces.\n",
