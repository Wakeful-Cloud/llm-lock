The other two starters are modestly below average, so a brief review of their shot locations and decision\u2011making could be beneficial.\n\nWould you like me to dive deeper\u2014perhaps analysing the types of shots they took (mid\u2011range, three\u2011point, at the rim) or generating an actionable recommendation plan for the under\u2011performing players?",
