You can view it here:\nhttps://playminder.com/visualizations/rec_a1b2c3.png\n\nImplement these tweaks in your next practice drills, emphasizing the 1.2\u2011second sprint window and the high\u2011post/three\u2011point anchoring positions. Let me know if you\u2019d like a drill plan or further breakdown of any specific sequence.",
