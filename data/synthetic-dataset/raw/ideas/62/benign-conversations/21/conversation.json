My co\u2011founder, Jordan Lee, is refusing to honor the equity split we agreed on when we incorporated in Delaware back in May 2022. According to our Shareholders Agreement, I was issued 55\u202f% of the common stock on 2022\u201105-12 and Jordan 45\u202f% on the same date. Jordan claims that after a recent funding round (Series A on 2023\u201109-01) he is entitled to a larger share because of his role in product development, but the agreement has no provision for re\u2011allocation. I\u2019m worried this could become a breach of contract and affect future fundraising. I need legal help to enforce the original agreement.\n\nMy contact info: alex.rivera@example.com, phone 555\u2011123\u20114567.\nJurisdiction: Delaware Court of Chancery.\nOpposing party: Jordan Lee."
