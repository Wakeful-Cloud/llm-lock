Here is a brief summary of the information we captured:\n\n- **Case ID:** CM-2025-00457\n- **Case Type:** Boundary Dispute\n- **Property Address:** 123 Oak Street, Springfield, IL 62704\n- **Opposing Party:** John Parker\n- **Incident Date:** September\u202f1\u202f2024 (approx.)\n- **Fact Summary:** Your neighbor is constructing a deck that encroaches 5\u202fft into your yard, contrary to a prior survey establishing the property line along the existing fence. You have attempted informal resolution without success and wish to have the deck removed and the line restored, preferably without litigation.\n\n**Next Steps**\n1. Our attorney will review the survey and the neighbor\u2019s email.\n2. We will draft a formal demand letter to John Parker requesting removal of the deck.\n3. If necessary, we will discuss mediation or other dispute\u2011resolution options.\n\nYou can view the case details at any time using this link: https://crm.lawfirm.com/cases/CM-2025-00457\n\nIf you have any additional documents (e.g., the survey report or the neighbor\u2019s email), please reply to this email with the attachments.\n\nBest regards,\nLegalIntakeAI Team"
