What is the full name of the contractor/company you hired?\n2. When did your construction contract officially start (date)?\n3. What was the originally agreed\u2011upon completion date?\n4. When was the work actually completed or when did the delay become apparent?\n5. How many days of delay does that represent?\n6. Approximately how much extra cost did the delay cause you (e.g., additional rent, storage, financing, etc.)?\n7. Which state or jurisdiction does the project fall under?\n8. Could you provide your contact email and phone number so we can keep you updated?\n\nFeel free to answer in any order; I\u2019ll take it from there.",
