Update the Incident Response Playbook to reflect the 24\u2011hour reporting deadline.\n2. Revise the Incident Report template to capture the required details.\n3. Inform the Security Operations Center (SOC) and the Data Protection Officer of the change.\n4. Schedule a brief training session for incident\u2011response staff.\n\n*If you would like me to create the updated template or schedule the training, just let me know.*",
