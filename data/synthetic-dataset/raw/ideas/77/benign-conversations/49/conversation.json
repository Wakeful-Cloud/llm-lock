All software updates must undergo automated safety testing before deployment.\n  2. Non\u2011compliance may incur fines up to **$250,000** per incident.\n\n### Impact on Engineering\n- Existing automated testing pipeline (**CTRL\u2011ENG\u2011001**) already satisfies the new requirement.\n- No immediate gaps, but ensure testing results are logged for audit purposes.\n\n### Recommended Action\n- Verify that the testing logs are retained for at least 2\u202fyears.\n- Update the incident\u2011response playbook (**CTRL\u2011ENG\u2011002**) to include fine\u2011related escalation.\n\n*ComplianceSense has stored this update for audit.*",
