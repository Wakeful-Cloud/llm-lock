Update the License Request SOP to include ECCN\u202f5A992 references.\n2. Retrain export compliance analysts on the new classification.\n3.

Items now require an export license for any destination outside the United States, whereas they were previously exempt under 5A991.\n\n**Key Impacts on Our Operations**\n1. **Export Classification Verification (CTRL\u2011EXP\u2011001)** \u2013 Already aligned with the new classification; no immediate action required.\n2. **License Request Workflow (CTRL\u2011EXP\u2011002)** \u2013 Does **not** reference ECCN\u202f5A992; the SOP must be updated to include this new ECCN and the associated licensing thresholds.\n3. **Pending Shipments** \u2013 High\u2011performance computer shipments scheduled after Dec\u202f1\u202f2025 may be non\u2011compliant if the new licensing step is omitted.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps**\n1. Revise the License Request SOP to incorporate ECCN\u202f5A992 references and required documentation.\n2. Conduct a focused training session for export compliance analysts on the re\u2011classification and its practical implications.\n3. Perform a quick audit of all open export licences and pending shipments of high\u2011performance computers to ensure compliance before the effective date.\n4. Monitor the BIS feed for any additional clarifications or related amendments.\n\nThe alert with this summary and the recommended actions has been posted to the **#compliance\u2011team** Slack channel and emailed to Alice Jones. The update has also been recorded in the compliance database (record ID: reg_update_987654321).\n\n*Prepared by ComplianceSense*",
