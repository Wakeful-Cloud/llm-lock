Update the emission\u2011threshold calculation in the GHG reporting system (target completion: 30\u202fNov\u202f2025).\n2. Revise the XML template according to Appendix A (target completion: 15\u202fDec\u202f2025).\n3. Schedule a brief cross\u2011functional review meeting (invite: Sustainability Lead, IT, Compliance).\n\nPlease acknowledge receipt and confirm the timelines.\n",
