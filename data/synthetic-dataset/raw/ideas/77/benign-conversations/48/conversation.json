The most relevant points for our merger planning are:\n\n1. **Turnover Threshold** \u2013 Mandatory EU merger notification now kicks in at \u20ac5\u202fbn combined worldwide turnover (down from \u20ac8\u202fbn). Your current pre\u2011screening tool must be adjusted.\n2. **Market\u2011Share Test** \u2013 The 30\u202f% post\u2011merger market\u2011share threshold remains, but the Commission will apply it more rigorously, especially for borderline cases.\n3. **Digital Platform Exception** \u2013 A new regime for digital\u2011platform deals introduces a lower 20\u202f% market\u2011share limit and requires the merged entity to grant data\u2011access rights to competitors.\n4. **Notification Deadline** \u2013 The filing period is shortened to 25 working days after the merger decision.\n\n**Impact on our processes**\n- Update internal control **CTRL\u2011MERGER\u2011001** to reflect the \u20ac5\u202fbn threshold.\n- Revise the project timeline to meet the 25\u2011day filing window (control **CTRL\u2011NOTICE\u2011004**).\n- Add a dedicated checklist for digital\u2011platform acquisitions (control **CTRL\u2011DIGITAL\u2011003**).\n- Communicate these changes to the M&A team and ensure all upcoming deals are re\u2011evaluated against the new thresholds.\n\nAn email alert with these highlights and the recommended actions has been sent to the compliance officer and the M&A lead. The full guideline text and the cross\u2011reference analysis have been archived in the compliance database (record ID REG-2024-001-01) for future reference.\n\nLet me know if you need a deeper dive into any specific clause or assistance updating the internal controls.",
