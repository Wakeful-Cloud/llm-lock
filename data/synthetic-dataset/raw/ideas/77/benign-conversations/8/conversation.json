Move SDS to a cloud\u2011based searchable system (replace SOP\u2011002).\n3. Add a 30\u2011day risk\u2011assessment trigger for new chemicals (modify SOP\u2011003).\n\nI\u2019ve sent a Slack alert to the compliance and operations teams and logged the change in the compliance database (record ID **rec-7890**). Let me know if you\u2019d like a draft amendment to the SOPs or assistance with selecting a digital training solution.",
