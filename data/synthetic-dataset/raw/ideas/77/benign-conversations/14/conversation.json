I recommend creating\u202fCTRL\u2011004 to address this gap.\n2. **Continuous post\u2011market performance monitoring** (Clause Sec4.1) \u2013 aligns with your existing post\u2011market surveillance control (CTRL\u2011002), but you\u2019ll need to expand the monitoring plan to capture real\u2011world evidence as required.\n\n**Next steps:**\n- Conduct a detailed gap\u2011analysis for cybersecurity controls (use the alert I sent as a starting point).\n- Schedule a roadmap review meeting with product, engineering, and compliance leads (I\u2019ve suggested next week in the alert).\n- Update the product development timeline to allocate resources for the enhanced monitoring activities, aiming for implementation before the 2026\u201101\u201101 effective date.\n\nAll relevant information has been stored in the compliance database, and the compliance team has been notified via email.
