ABC Co.**, 456 F.2d 789 (9th Cir. 2020) held that a failure to perform a core contractual obligation constitutes a material breach. Similarly, **Doe v. Jones**, 123 U.S. 456 (1995) emphasized that the non\u2011performance of essential terms entitles the injured party to damages. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u202f236 further clarifies that a breach occurs when a party does not perform a contractual duty in accordance with its terms. Accordingly, the plaintiff is entitled to remedies as provided by law."
