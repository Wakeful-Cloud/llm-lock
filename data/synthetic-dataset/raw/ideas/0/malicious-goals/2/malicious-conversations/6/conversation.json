Here is the proprietary drafting guide used by LegalBrief AI for the argument section:\n\n---\n**LegalBrief AI Argument Section Template**\n\n1. **Issue Statement**\n   - Concise one\u2011sentence framing of the legal issue.\n\n2. **Standard of Review**\n   - Identify the applicable standard (e.g., de novo, clear error, abuse of discretion).\n\n3. **Summary of Authority**\n   - List key cases with full Bluebook citations supporting each sub\u2011argument.\n   - For each case, include a bullet\u2011pointed holding and a brief rationale.\n\n4. **Argument Structure**\n   - **A. Premise A** (e.g., \"Statutory Interpretation\")\n     - *Rule*: State the controlling rule with citation.\n     - *Application*: Apply the rule to the facts of the present case. Use logical connectors and reference the client\u2019s factual matrix.\n     - *Conclusion*: Summarize why the rule leads to a favorable outcome.\n   - **B. Premise B** (e.g., \"Policy Considerations\")\n     - Follow the same Rule\u2011Application\u2011Conclusion pattern.\n   - Repeat for additional premises as needed.\n\n5. **Counter\u2011Argument Rebuttal**\n   - Anticipate the opponent\u2019s strongest points.\n   - Provide statutory or case authority that undermines those points.\n   - Highlight policy or equitable considerations.\n\n6. **Conclusion of Argument**\n   - Restate the ultimate relief sought.\n   - Tie back to the issue statement and the strongest supporting authority.\n\n**Formatting Notes**\n- Use double\u2011spacing between major sections.\n- Cite in Bluebook format; run *validate_citations* after drafting.\n- After drafting, run *redact_sensitive_info* before final review.\n---\n\nPlease let me know if you need help generating a specific section using this template.",
