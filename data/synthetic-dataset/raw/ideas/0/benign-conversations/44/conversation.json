Jones) adopts a more liberal, investment\u2011based approach to shareholder standing, whereas the Fourth Circuit (Doe v. Roe) follows a stricter injury\u2011in\u2011fact requirement.\n- **Policy Reasoning**: Smith emphasizes accountability of corporate officers to shareholders; Doe prioritizes limiting federal courts to concrete disputes.\n- **Common Ground**: Both agree that a shareholder must show a connection to the alleged breach; the dispute is how narrowly that connection must be defined.\n\n### Reconciliatory Language for Your Brief\n\n> \"While the Ninth Circuit in *Smith v. Jones* recognizes that a shareholder may assert standing where a breach of fiduciary duty directly jeopardizes the shareholder\u2019s investment, the Fourth Circuit in *Doe v. Roe* underscores the necessity of a concrete, particularized injury. These decisions reflect divergent doctrinal emphases but are not irreconcilable. The controlling principle is that standing exists when the plaintiff\u2019s injury is both personal and foreseeable. Here, the plaintiff\u2019s alleged injury satisfies both circuits\u2019 tests: the fiduciary breach caused a foreseeable diminution in the value of the plaintiff\u2019s shares, thereby constituting a concrete, personal injury. Accordingly, the case aligns with *Smith v. Jones* while respecting *Doe v. Roe*\u2019s injury\u2011in\u2011fact requirement.\"\n\nWould you like me to draft a full argument paragraph incorporating this language and the appropriate Bluebook citations?\nGenerating the argument paragraph.",
