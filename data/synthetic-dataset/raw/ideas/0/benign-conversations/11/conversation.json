Jones*, a breach must be \"substantial\" and affect the core purpose of the contract to be deemed material. Minor performance shortfalls that do not undermine the contract\u2019s essential purpose are insufficient.\n2. **Admission Context.** The language in Email E.1\u2014\"minor issue\" and \"do not intend to pursue any claim\"\u2014demonstrates that ABC Corp. does not consider the deficiency to be material. This admission aligns with the principle that parties may elect to waive minor breaches without forfeiting contractual rights.\n3. **Rule 12(b)(6) Applicability.** A motion to dismiss requires a bare allegation of a claim. Here, the plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges a material breach without supporting facts that the performance shortfall was substantial.
