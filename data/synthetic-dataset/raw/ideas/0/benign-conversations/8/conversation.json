      "content": "- **Facts**: The plaintiff, Acme Corp., entered into a supply contract with Defendant, Beta Logistics, for delivery of 10,000 widgets. The contract required delivery by June 1, 2023, and payment upon receipt. Beta Logistics failed to deliver 4,000 widgets and invoiced for the full amount. Acme Corp. claimed breach of contract and sought damages.\n- **Issue**: Whether Beta Logistics materially breached the supply contract by delivering fewer widgets than required and whether Acme Corp. is entitled to recover the contract price for the undelivered widgets.\n- **Holding**: The court held that Beta Logistics materially breached the contract by delivering only 6,000 of the 10,000 widgets, and therefore Acme Corp. is entitled to recover damages equal to the contract price of the undelivered 4,000 widgets plus incidental costs.\n- **Reasoning**: The court applied the doctrine of material breach, emphasizing that delivery of substantially less than the contracted quantity defeats the contract's essential purpose. It rejected Beta Logistics' argument that a force\u2011majeure clause excused performance, finding no qualifying event. The court also cited *Smith v. Jones*, 123 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2020) for the standard that a breach is material when it substantially impairs the value of the contract to the non\u2011breaching party."
