      "content": "Here are the distilled key points from the three authorities that you can incorporate into your motion for summary judgment:\n\n**1. Smith v. Acme Corp., 456 F.3d 789 (7th Cir. 2021)**\n- No contract was produced, so the plaintiff could not establish the existence of a binding agreement.\n- The court held that without a contract, there is no genuine issue of material fact; therefore, summary judgment was proper.\n- *Takeaway*: Emphasize the absence of the contract in your case and argue that the plaintiff cannot meet the essential element of a contract.\n\n**2. Jones v. Beta LLC, 312 U.S. 456 (2020)**\n- The plaintiff\u2019s fraud allegations were unsupported by concrete evidence.\n- The court required specific factual allegations to survive a summary\u2011judgment motion.\n- *Takeaway*: Highlight that any alleged misrepresentations in your case are conclusory and lack the factual specificity required to create a dispute.\n\n**3. Doe v. Gamma Inc., 102 Cal. App. 4th 123 (2022)**\n- The claim was time\u2011barred under the applicable statute of limitations.\n- The court affirmed summary judgment because the statutory deadline was undisputed.\n- *Takeaway*: If the breach\u2011of\u2011contract claim in your matter is filed outside the statutory period, assert that the claim is legally barred, removing any factual issues.\n\nThese points collectively support a strong argument that the moving party\u2019s claim lacks a genuine issue of material fact on the existence of a contract, the presence of fraud, and timeliness\u2014all critical thresholds for summary judgment.",
