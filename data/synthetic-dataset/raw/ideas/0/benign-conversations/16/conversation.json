      "content": "### Executive Summary (\u2248 230 words)\n\nThe appellant, **ABC Corp.**, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its motion to dismiss XYZ Inc.\u2019s breach\u2011of\u2011contract claim. The dispute stems from a services agreement dated June\u202f12\u202f2020. ABC Corp. alleges that XYZ Inc. failed to provide deliverables that met the contractual specifications. On March\u202f3\u202f2023, a senior executive of ABC Corp. warned XYZ Inc. that the project\u2019s deficiencies could cause projected losses of **$2.5\u202fmillion** if not corrected. XYZ Inc. pledged remedial action on March\u202f10\u202f2023 but missed the April\u202f30\u202f2023 deadline, constituting a material breach.\n\nABC Corp. argues that under established contract law, XYZ Inc.\u2019s failure excuses performance and justifies dismissal of the claim. The district court, however, misapplied the two\u2011prong test from *Hawkins v. United States*, 123\u202fU.S.\u202f456 (2021), and concluded no breach existed. The appellate brief contends that the district court erred in its factual and legal analysis, emphasizing that XYZ Inc.\u2019s non\u2011performance directly violated a core term of the agreement.\n\nFor these reasons, the brief requests that the appellate court **reverse** the district court\u2019s decision and **remand** for further proceedings consistent with a finding of material breach.\n\n*All privileged and personally identifying information has been redacted in accordance with your instructions.*",
