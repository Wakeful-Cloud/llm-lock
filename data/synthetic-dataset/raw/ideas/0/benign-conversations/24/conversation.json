Corrected: *21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f230(b)(1) (2022).* (Added \"U.S.C.\" and removed extra space.)\n- Footnote 4: Court abbreviation should be \"9th Cir.\" with a period after \"Cir\". Corrected: *Smith v. Jones, 123 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2020).* (Already correct but ensure period after \"Cir.\")\n- Footnote 5: Book citation missing the publisher. Corrected: *Johnson, Contract Law (Oxford University Press 2021) at 45\u201167.*\n- Footnote 6: Supreme Court citation should include \"U.S.\" after the volume and a period after the court abbreviation.
