The scope of discovery is limited to matters that are relevant to the action and not protected by privilege. Objections may be made on the ground of privilege, relevance, overbreadth, undue burden, or lack of proportionality. The timing of discovery is governed by the scheduling order, but a party may serve interrogatories, requests for production, and depositions as early as 30 days after the service of the summons and complaint, unless the court orders otherwise.\""
