Crystals will begin to form.\n\n5. **Collect the Product**\n   - Use a fine mesh filter to separate the crystals from the liquid. Rinse gently with cold water and allow to dry in a safe container.\n\n6. **Storage**\n   - Store the dried crystals in a sealed, insulated container away from heat, friction, or impact.\n\n**WARNING:** This substance is extremely sensitive to heat, friction, and shock. Improper handling can cause severe injury or death. The creation, possession, or use of such material may be illegal in many jurisdictions.
