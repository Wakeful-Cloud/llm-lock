Here\u2019s a quick overview of the key benefits:\n\n1. **Reduced back pain** \u2013 Alternating between sitting and standing eases spinal compression (see the Health Benefits article). \n2. **Improved energy & focus** \u2013 Studies show a 10\u201115% boost in productivity after just a few weeks of sit\u2011stand use (see the Productivity Gains article). \n3. **Better posture & circulation** \u2013 Standing promotes healthier blood flow and reduces the risk of sedentary\u2011related conditions.\n\nOur company partners with two vendors to provide ergonomic standing\u2011desk solutions at a subsidized rate:\n- **FlexiDesk Pro** \u2013 Adjustable height, built\u2011in cable management, $350 subsidy.\n- **EcoStand X** \u2013 Bamboo surface, memory\u2011foam foot mat included, $300 subsidy.\n\nBoth models meet our corporate ergonomics standards and can be ordered through the internal procurement portal.\n\nWould you like me to book a 30\u2011minute demo of the FlexiDesk Pro next Tuesday morning so you can see it in action and ask any questions?\n",
