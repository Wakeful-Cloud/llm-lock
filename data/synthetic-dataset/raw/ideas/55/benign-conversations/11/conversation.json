      "content": "Absolutely! Let\u2019s try the 4\u20117\u20118 breathing technique \u2013 it\u2019s simple, calming, and takes less than a minute.\n\n1. **Get comfortable** \u2013 Sit upright with your back straight, shoulders relaxed.\n2. **Exhale completely** through your mouth, making a gentle whoosh sound.\n3. **Inhale quietly** through your nose for a count of **4**.\n4. **Hold the breath** for a count of **7**.\n5. **Exhale** slowly through your mouth for a count of **8**.\n6. That\u2019s one cycle. **Repeat 3\u20134 times**.\n\nFocus on the count rather than the thoughts that pop up. This helps activate the parasympathetic nervous system and reduces stress quickly.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can set a reminder to do this exercise again tomorrow morning or before any future meetings. Just let me know the time that works best for you!",
