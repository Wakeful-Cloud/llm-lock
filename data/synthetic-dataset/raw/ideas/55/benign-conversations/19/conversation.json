Your survey shows you prefer a vegetarian diet, and your recent fitness data indicates you\u2019re getting about 6\u202fhours of sleep a night, which can contribute to that mid\u2011day dip. A quick, protein\u2011rich snack can help stabilize blood\u2011sugar and keep you alert.\n\n**Snack suggestion:**\n- **Greek yogurt (plain, 150\u202fg)** topped with a tablespoon of **chopped almonds** and a drizzle of **honey**. This provides roughly 15\u202fg of protein, healthy fats, and a touch of natural sweetness for a steady energy boost.\n\nI\u2019ll add a 10\u2011minute \u201cSnack & Stretch\u201d break to your calendar today at 2:30\u202fPM so you have a dedicated moment to refuel, and I\u2019ll send you a reminder a few minutes before.\n\nWould you like me to schedule that now?",
