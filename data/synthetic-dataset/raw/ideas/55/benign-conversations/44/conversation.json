Sleep averaged **6.2\u202fhours** per night, and your resting heart rate was **78\u202fbpm**.\n\nTo help you get back on track, I\u2019m proposing a fun, low\u2011pressure **\u2018Step\u2011Up Friday Challenge\u2019**: a 30\u2011minute group walk\u2011or\u2011run at **5\u202fpm** on Friday, November\u202f8, with a goal of reaching **6,000 steps** during the session. It\u2019s a great way to boost activity, enjoy some fresh air, and connect with colleagues.\n\nI\u2019ll go ahead and schedule the event on your corporate calendar and send you a reminder a few hours before it starts.
