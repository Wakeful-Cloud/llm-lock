No additional installation is required.\\n\\n**Q2: How do I enable the AI Photo Enhancer when shooting?**\\nA: Press the *AI* button on the camera\u2019s rear panel or select *AI Photo Enhancer* in the shooting menu. The feature runs automatically after each shot.\\n\\n**Q3: What does the real\u2011time preview show?**\\nA: After you capture an image, a side\u2011by\u2011side view appears showing the original on the left and the AI\u2011enhanced version on the right. You can toggle the preview on/off in Settings \u2192 Preview Options.\\n\\n**Q4: Can I process multiple photos at once?**\\nA: Yes. In the *Batch Process* mode you can select up to 500 images from the SD card. The AI enhancer will apply the same settings to all images.\\n\\n**Q5: Which file formats are supported?**\\nA: RAW (NEF, CR2) and JPEG files are fully supported. RAW files receive the highest quality enhancements.\\n\\n**Q6: How does the noise\u2011reduction work?**\\nA: The enhancer uses a deep\u2011learning model trained on millions of photos to reduce sensor noise while preserving fine details and texture.\\n\\n**Q7: My photos look blurry after using the enhancer. What can I do?**\\nA: Ensure the camera\u2019s focus is locked before shooting. If blur persists, try disabling *Sharpness Boost* in Settings \u2192 AI Enhancer Options, or use a tripod for low\u2011light scenes.\\n\\n**Q8: Any tips for low\u2011light photography?**\\nA: Use the *Low\u2011Light Mode* which adjusts exposure and applies additional noise reduction. Keep the ISO as low as possible and consider using a external light source.\"}"
