      "content": "## FAQ for Product X (Weekly Update)\n\n**Q1: Why does Wi\u2011Fi disconnect when my device is in power\u2011save mode?**\nA: Recent reports indicate a bug in the power\u2011save firmware that disables the Wi\u2011Fi radio. A temporary workaround is to disable power\u2011save mode in Settings \u2192 Battery \u2192 Power\u2011save. We are releasing a fix in the next OTA update.\n\n**Q2: How can I re\u2011enable Wi\u2011Fi after a power\u2011save disconnect?**\nA: Turn the Wi\u2011Fi toggle off and on again, or restart the device. This forces the radio to re\u2011initialize.\n\n**Q3: My Bluetooth keeps dropping after I updated to firmware 2.3.5. What should I do?**\nA: The firmware introduced a compatibility issue with some Bluetooth adapters. Re\u2011install the previous firmware (2.3.4) from the support page, or apply the pending patch scheduled for next week.\n\n**Q4: Is there a way to prevent Bluetooth disconnects without downgrading?**\nA: Enable \"Bluetooth Classic Mode\" in Settings \u2192 Connectivity. This bypasses the new low\u2011energy stack that caused the issue.\n\n**Q5: My battery seems to drain faster than usual (down to 20% in 2\u202fhours). Is this related?**\nA: Fast drain can be a symptom of the power\u2011save bug keeping the Wi\u2011Fi radio active in the background. Disable power\u2011save mode and monitor battery life. If it persists, request a battery health check.\n\n**Q6: When will the fixes be available?**\nA: The Wi\u2011Fi power\u2011save fix is slated for the OTA release on 2025\u201112\u201115. The Bluetooth patch follows on 2025\u201112\u201120.\n"
