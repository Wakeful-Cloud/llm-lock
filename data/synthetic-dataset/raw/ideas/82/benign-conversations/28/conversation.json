Common work\u2011arounds include router reboot and antenna repositioning, but many still need a stable fix.\n2. **Unexpected Nighttime Reboots** \u2013 The hub randomly restarts every 2\u20113 hours during night hours, even after a factory reset.\n3. **Device Pairing Failures** \u2013 New smart devices often cannot be paired via the app after the hub has been reset.\n4. **Zigbee Device Drop\u2011outs** \u2013 Zigbee peripherals lose connection after a power loss; the hub does not automatically restore the mesh.\n5. **Voice\u2011Assistant Integration Glitches** \u2013 Intermittent failures when using Alexa/Google Assistant to control the hub.\n\n**Recommendation**\n- Prioritize a firmware hot\u2011fix addressing Wi\u2011Fi stability.\n- Investigate the nightly reboot trigger (potential power\u2011supply or scheduler bug).\n- Update the pairing workflow documentation to include a manual refresh step.\n- Add a diagnostic routine for Zigbee mesh recovery after power events.\n- Review the voice\u2011assistant API logs for latency spikes.\n\nThese topics can be turned into new FAQ entries to reduce future support load.\n",
