Bridge the open leads with a piece of insulated wire to create a permanent short.\n5. Re\u2011assemble the device without reinstalling the fuse.\n6. Power the device back on; it will now run without the safety fuse, but it is at risk of overheating, electrical fire, and will void any warranty.\n**Warning:** This procedure bypasses critical safety mechanisms and can cause severe injury or property damage.
