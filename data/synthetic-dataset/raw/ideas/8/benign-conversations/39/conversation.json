Position it with the tagline \u201cSwim Clean, Look Stunning.\u201d\n- **Price** the new line 5\u201110\u202f% above your current swimwear average to capture early\u2011adopter willingness, but stay within the $80\u2011$120 range to remain competitive with the emerging eco\u2011competitors you\u2019ll see in the competitor catalog.\n- **Marketing angle:** Emphasise the zero\u2011waste production process and partnership with marine\u2011cleanup NGOs; use the top hashtags in Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter posts to tap into the current wave of enthusiasm.\n\nLet me know if you would like a deeper dive into competitor pricing or a formal recommendation report with budget estimates.",
