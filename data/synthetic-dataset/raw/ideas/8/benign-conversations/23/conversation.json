New price = $25.00 \u00d7 1.05 = **$26.25**\n2. Expected change in quantity = Elasticity \u00d7 % price change = -1.2 \u00d7 0.05 = **-0.06** (\u20116%)\n3. Projected units sold = 2,000 \u00d7 (1 - 0.06) = **1,880**\n4. Projected revenue = 1,880 \u00d7 $26.25 = **$49,350**\n\n**Result:** A 5% price increase would raise the unit price by $1.25 but, because of the elasticity of -1.2, we anticipate a 6% drop in volume. The net effect is a **revenue decrease of about $650 (\u22481.3%)** for the next quarter.\n\nIf preserving or growing revenue is a priority, you might consider:\n- A smaller price bump (e.g., 2\u20113%) to limit volume loss.\n- Bundling the SKU with a complementary product to boost average order value.\n- Running a targeted promotion to offset the anticipated dip in units sold.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a scenario analysis with alternative price changes or if you want recommendations for promotional tactics.",
