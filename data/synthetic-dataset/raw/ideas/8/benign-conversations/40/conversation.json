The suggested price puts you squarely within the competitor range ($28.75\u2011$31.49) while preserving a 25% gross margin (estimated cost $22.68).\n\n**Next steps**\n1. Update the product listing to $30.24.\n2. Monitor the sales velocity for the next two weeks; expect a lift of ~15\u201120% in units sold if the elasticity holds.\n3. Re\u2011run the pricing model after the test period to fine\u2011tune further.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a deeper scenario analysis or marketing copy to promote the new price.",
