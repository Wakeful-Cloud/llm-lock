Competitor backpacks are priced between $78 and $85, with some offering up to 10\u202f% discounts, so $84 keeps you competitive while still meeting your 30\u202f% gross\u2011margin target.\n\nYou can apply this price immediately or let me know if you\u2019d like to run a short\u2011term A/B test before committing.",
