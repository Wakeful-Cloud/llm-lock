      "content": "Here\u2019s the snapshot of artisan candle offerings from three leading competitors:\n\n- **Price range**: $14.99\u202f\u2013\u202f$59.99\n- **Most common price brackets**:\n  - $15\u2011$25 (3 items)\n  - $26\u2011$35 (1 item)\n  - $46\u2011$50 (1 item)\n  - $55\u2011$60 (1 item)\n\n**Observations**\n1. The $30\u2011$45 band is sparsely populated \u2013 only one competitor (Ocean Breeze Soy Candle at $34.75) sits there.\n2. Mid\u2011tier candles ($35\u2011$45) appear to be an untapped niche; most competitors cluster either low\u2011end (<$25) or premium (> $50).\n3. Stock levels are healthy for low\u2011end and mid\u2011range items, while the premium candle is out of stock, indicating potential demand.\n\n**Recommendation**\n- Introduce an **artisan candle line priced between $32\u2011$42**. A flagship scent (e.g., \u201cVanilla & Tobacco\u201d) at $38 could capture shoppers seeking a step\u2011up from budget candles without paying premium prices.\n- Position it with a **hand\u2011poured, soy\u2011based story** to differentiate from the low\u2011end mass\u2011produced options.\n- Launch a limited\u2011edition set (2\u20113 pieces) at $55\u2011$60 to test the high\u2011end segment without cannibalizing the new mid\u2011tier line.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a deeper dive into consumer sentiment around these scents or a pricing model simulation for the proposed SKU.",
