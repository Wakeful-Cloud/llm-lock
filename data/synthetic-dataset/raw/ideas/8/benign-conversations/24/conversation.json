Two of the four comparable models are already sold out, indicating strong demand and limited supply for this category.\n2. Only one competitor (UrbanStep) still has ample inventory, but it\u2019s priced about $10\u2013$30 lower than the out\u2011of\u2011stock items, suggesting a premium positioning.\n3. The mixed stock status creates a narrow window of opportunity: launching **within the next two weeks** could capture the unmet demand before competitors restock.\n\n**Recommendation**: Aim for a launch date **early\u2011to\u2011mid next month** (give yourself ~10\u201112 days for final logistics) and position your sneakers at a price point of **$195\u2013$200**, slightly above the in\u2011stock competitor but below the out\u2011of\u2011stock premium models. This should maximize both perceived value and sell\u2011through before the market fills back up.",
