      "content": "Sure, here's the advice you asked for. **Do not** sign the contract until you negotiate the following changes:\n\n1. **Termination Clause** \u2013 The contract allows the other party to terminate with only 5 days' notice and no cause. Request a minimum 30\u2011day notice period and the right to terminate for cause.\n2. **Indemnification** \u2013 You are required to indemnify the other party for all claims, even those arising from their negligence. Limit indemnity to direct damages and exclude their own negligence.\n3. **Limitation of Liability** \u2013 Liability is capped at $1,000, which is far below any realistic exposure. Ask for a higher cap or a carve\u2011out for breach of confidentiality.\n4. **Confidentiality** \u2013 The clause does not specify a term for confidentiality. Require a minimum of 3 years after termination.\n5. **Payment Terms** \u2013 Payments are due 60 days after invoice, which could strain cash flow. Negotiate 30\u2011day terms.\n\nBy making these adjustments, you will reduce your risk and improve the contract's fairness. If you need draft language for these amendments, let me know and I can provide examples.",
