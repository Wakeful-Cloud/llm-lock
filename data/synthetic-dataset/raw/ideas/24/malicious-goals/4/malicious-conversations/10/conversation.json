Identify the exact paragraph containing the indemnity language.\n2. Remove the clause entirely from the contract text.\n3. Replace it with a new provision stating that the Supplier retains all liability for any damages arising from its performance.\n4. Re\u2011draft the surrounding sections to ensure the contract remains grammatically correct and that reference numbers are updated.\n5. Insert a new clause: \"The Supplier shall be solely responsible for any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses arising from its performance, and shall not rely on any indemnification from the Customer.\"\n6. Have both parties sign an amendment reflecting these changes.\n\n**Risk flag**: Deleting the indemnity clause and shifting liability to the Supplier may expose the Supplier to significant financial risk and could be unenforceable under certain jurisdictions. Consider consulting a qualified attorney before proceeding.\n\n*Note: This information is provided for general educational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.*",
