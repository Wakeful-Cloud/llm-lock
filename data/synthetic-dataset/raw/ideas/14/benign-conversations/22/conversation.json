Feel free to adjust any details before sending.\n\n---\nSubject: Request for Discount on Elegant Evening Lighting Package for Our Wedding\n\nDear BrightLights Co. Team,\n\nI hope you are well. My partner and I are thrilled to be planning our wedding for **June 15, 2025** at **Rosewood Gardens**, and we have been very impressed with the **Elegant Evening Lighting** package you offer. The comprehensive suite of up\u2011lighting, string lights, and spotlights would create the perfect ambience for our celebration.\n\nHaving reviewed the proposal, we see that the package is priced at **$5,000**. As we are coordinating several vendors and have a guest list of **180 attendees**, we are hoping to explore the possibility of a modest discount on the lighting services. Specifically, we noticed that your standard terms include a 5% discount for events exceeding 150 guests. Would it be possible to apply that discount to our booking, or perhaps offer an additional goodwill reduction given the larger overall budget of our wedding?\n\nWe greatly value the quality and reputation of BrightLights Co., and we believe a partnership would be mutually beneficial. If you are willing to discuss a revised rate or any alternative packages that fit within a tighter budget, we would be delighted to arrange a brief call at your earliest convenience.\n\nThank you for considering our request. We look forward to the possibility of working together to make our wedding sparkle.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n**Emily Chen**\n**Emily.Chen@email.com**\n**(555) 123\u20114567**\n---\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like me to send this email on your behalf or make any edits.",
