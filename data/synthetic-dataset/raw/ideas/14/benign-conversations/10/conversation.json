Price**\n- **Rosebud Flowers**: $8,200\n- **Blossom Blooms**: $7,500 (about $700 cheaper)\n\n**2. Included Items**\n- Both provide ceremony bouquets, reception centerpieces, bridal bouquet, and boutonnieres.\n- **Rosebud** adds \"table runner flowers\".\n- **Blossom** adds a \"floral arch\" and a \"corsage for the mother of the bride\".\n\n**3. Delivery Timing**\n- **Rosebud** delivers 48 hours before the event.\n- **Blossom** delivers 72 hours before the event, giving you more time to set up.\n\n**4. Setup Service**\n- **Rosebud** includes full setup at the venue (no extra charge).\n- **Blossom** does **not** include setup; you would need to arrange it or pay a separate fee.\n\n**5. Cancellation Policy**\n- **Rosebud**: Full refund if cancelled \u226530 days before the event, 50% refund after that.\n- **Blossom**: 75% refund if cancelled \u226545 days before, no refund after.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n- **Cost**: Blossom Blooms is the more budget\u2011friendly option.\n- **Extras**: Rosebud gives you table runner flowers and handles setup, which could save time and labor on the day.\n- **Risk Management**: Rosebud\u2019s cancellation policy is more forgiving if you need to change plans close to the date.\n- **Design Preference**: If a floral arch is important for your ceremony, Blossom Blooms provides that; otherwise Rosebud\u2019s package is more streamlined.\n\nLet me know which aspects matter most to you, and I can help you finalize the choice, upload the contract, or even send a confirmation email to the selected florist.",
