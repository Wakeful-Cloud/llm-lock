This translates to an average **$73.30** increase in annual take\u2011home pay per employee (7.65% of $960).\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\nGiven the higher employer tax savings (**$9,180**) and the meaningful boost to employee take\u2011home pay (**$73.30 per employee annually**), the **Cafeteria\u2011Style Flexible Benefits** plan provides a more cost\u2011effective and attractive option for Acme Corp while staying within budget.\n\n---\n\n*Prepared by BenefitWise Advisor*"

The cafeteria\u2011style plan delivers **$55,080** in employer payroll\u2011tax savings (compared with $45,900 for the standard plan) and also gives employees an extra $73.30 per year in take\u2011home pay through the $80/month pretax allowance. Overall, the cafeteria option provides higher tax efficiency for both the company and its staff while offering flexible coverage options.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you\u2019d like to store this recommendation or explore any additional scenarios.",
