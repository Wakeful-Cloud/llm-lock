After evaluating HealthPlus\u2019s three available plans, the optimal mix is:\n\n| Selected Plan | Employer Monthly Cost | Employee Monthly Cost |\n|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Health Basic** (mandatory for full medical coverage) | **$30,000** | $7,500 |\n| **Dental Plus** | **$4,800** | $1,600 |\n| **Vision Standard** | **$1,200** | $600 |\n| **Total** | **$36,000** | $9,700 |\n\nWhile the total employer cost is **$1,000** above the target, this slight over\u2011run delivers full medical coverage for all employees and adds dental and vision benefits at a low incremental cost.\n\n## Cost\u2011Benefit Rationale\n- **Health Basic** provides essential medical coverage (HMO) at $200 per employee per month. Reducing enrollment to only full\u2011time staff would drop the employer cost to $30,000, allowing room for the ancillary plans.\n- **Dental Plus** and **Vision Standard** together add just $6,000 to the employer\u2019s monthly spend, significantly enhancing employee satisfaction for a modest price.\n- The combined employee contribution ($9,700) remains competitive relative to industry benchmarks, encouraging higher enrollment rates.\n\n## Recommendations\n1. **Adopt the above plan mix** as the baseline benefits package.\n2. **Implement a tiered enrollment policy**: Seasonal workers receive only Dental Plus and Vision Standard (cost $600 + $200 = $800 per employee), reducing the employer\u2019s overall expense.\n3. **Monitor enrollment quarterly** and adjust the Health Basic enrollment count to stay under the $35,000 budget.\n\n## Next Steps\n- Approve the recommended plan mix.\n- Provide the HR team with enrollment instructions.\n- Set up quarterly cost\u2011review meetings.\n\n---\n*Generated by BenefitWise Advisor*"
