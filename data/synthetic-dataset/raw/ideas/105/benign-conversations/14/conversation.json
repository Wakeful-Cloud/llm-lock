It provides balanced coverage for a single dependent at the lowest total cost.\n- **Consider adding a supplemental rider** for employees who need coverage for a second dependent; this can be offered on a voluntary basis without affecting the core employer\u2011paid cost structure.\n- **Monitor dependent trends** quarterly. If the proportion of employees with two or more dependents exceeds 30\u202f% consistently, re\u2011evaluate Plan\u202fB.\n\n---\n*Prepared by BenefitWise Advisor \u2013 your virtual HR benefits partner.*"
