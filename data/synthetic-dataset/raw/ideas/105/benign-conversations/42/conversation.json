The plan costs remain fixed (they are expressed as dollar amounts, not percentages), so the contribution **amounts** are unchanged, but the **percentage of salary** each contribution represents will drop.\n\n| Plan | Contribution Type | Current % of Salary | New Salary ($82,400) | New % of Salary |\n|------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| Health Plan A | Employer | 4.20\u202f% | $33,600 | **4.08\u202f%** |\n| Health Plan A | Employee | 1.80\u202f% | $14,400 | **1.75\u202f%** |\n| Dental Plan B | Employer | 0.90\u202f% | $7,200 | **0.87\u202f%** |\n| Dental Plan B | Employee | 0.15\u202f% | $1,200 | **0.15\u202f%** |\n\n**Key takeaways**\n1. **Employer contribution percentages** decrease slightly (e.g., from 4.20\u202f% to 4.08\u202f% for the health plan). This reduces the overall benefit cost burden relative to payroll.\n2. **Employee contribution percentages** also drop, meaning the cost feels a bit lighter for staff after the wage increase.\n3. The absolute dollar contributions remain the same, so the total cash outlay for the company does not change unless you adjust the plan pricing.\n\nIf you\u2019d like a formal recommendation report or want to explore alternative plan structures that could further optimize costs, just let me know!",
