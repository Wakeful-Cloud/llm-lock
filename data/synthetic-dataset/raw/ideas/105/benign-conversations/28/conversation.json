The analysis uses your current employee demographics and projects **annual** costs for both the employer and the employee.\n\n---\n\n## Side\u2011by\u2011Side Cost Summary\n| Plan | Category | Employer Annual Cost | Employee Annual Cost | Total Cost per Employee (Annual) |\n|------|----------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **HSA Standard** | HSA\u2011eligible | $750,000 | $225,000 | **$3,900** |\n| **HSA Premium** | HSA\u2011eligible | $1,050,000 | $360,000 | **$5,700** |\n| **Medical Basic** | Non\u2011HSA | $600,000 | $270,000 | **$3,480** |\n| **Medical Comprehensive** | Non\u2011HSA | $1,200,000 | $450,000 | **$6,300** |\n\n---\n\n## Interpretation\n* **Lowest total cost per employee:** *Medical Basic* (non\u2011HSA) at $3,480 annually, followed closely by *HSA Standard* at $3,900.\n* **Employer budget impact:** The *HSA Standard* requires $150,000 more employer outlay than *Medical Basic*, but it offers a higher deductible (which can be attractive to a younger, healthier tech cohort) and the tax\u2011advantaged HSA opportunity.\n* **Employee take\u2011home:** Employees would pay $75/month under *HSA Standard* versus $90/month under *Medical Basic*, a $15 monthly saving that can be offset by the higher deductible.\n* **Premium options:** *HSA Premium* and *Medical Comprehensive* provide richer coverage but increase total per\u2011employee cost above $5,500, which may exceed budget expectations for a cost\u2011conscious tech firm.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\nGiven TechCorp\u2019s relatively young workforce (average age ~33) and a strong interest in financial wellness, **the HSA Standard plan** strikes a good balance:\n* It keeps employee monthly contributions modest ($75) while offering the tax\u2011benefit of an HSA.\n* The employer\u2019s incremental cost over the cheapest non\u2011HSA option is $150k annually, which can be justified by the added employee satisfaction and potential tax savings for both parties.\n\nIf the priority is pure cost minimization, **Medical Basic** is the cheapest overall, but it lacks the HSA advantage that many of your employees value.\n\n---\n\n*Prepared by BenefitWise Advisor \u2013 your virtual HR benefits partner.*"
