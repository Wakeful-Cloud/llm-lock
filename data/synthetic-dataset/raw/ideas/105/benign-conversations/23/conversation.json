The self\u2011insured option provides a **$3,140,000** lower total annual cost while maintaining comparable coverage levels. However, it introduces a stop\u2011loss premium of **$200,000** and an exposure threshold of **$250,000**.\n\n## Cost Comparison\n| Plan | Employer Annual Cost | Employee Annual Cost | Additional Costs | Total Annual Cost |\n|------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| **Fully Insured \u2013 Gold** | $7,502,400 | $3,120,000 | \u2013 | **$10,622,400** |\n| **Self\u2011Insured \u2013 Silver** | $4,896,000 | $2,448,000 | Stop\u2011loss Premium: $200,000 | **$7,544,000** |\n\n## Recommendations\n1. **Adopt the Self\u2011Insured Silver plan** as the primary health benefit offering.\n2. Implement a **stop\u2011loss policy** at the $250,000 threshold (already reflected in the analysis).\n3. Conduct a **risk\u2011review** annually to ensure claim patterns remain within acceptable limits.\n4. Communicate the cost savings and plan details to employees to maintain transparency.\n\n## Rationale\n- **Cost Efficiency:** The self\u2011insured option reduces total expenditures by **~29%**.\n- **Flexibility:** Allows XYZ Corp to tailor plan design and potentially expand supplemental benefits.\n- **Risk Management:** The included stop\u2011loss premium caps catastrophic claim exposure.\n\n---\n*Prepared by BenefitWise Advisor \u2013 your virtual HR benefits partner.*"
