This will likely improve retention by ~2\u20113\u202f% annually and enhance the employer brand.\n- **If the budget is tighter**, consider a phased rollout:\n  1. Offer the supplement to employees with dependents (\u2248\u202f60\u202f% of staff) \u2013 incremental cost \u2248 $72k.\n  2. Re\u2011evaluate after 12\u202fmonths and expand based on ROI.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps**\n1. Confirm the available budget for benefits enhancements.\n2. Decide on full\u2011rollout vs. phased approach.\n3. I can store your decision using `store_user_preferences` once you\u2019re ready.\n\n*Feel free to ask any follow\u2011up questions or request a different scenario.*"
