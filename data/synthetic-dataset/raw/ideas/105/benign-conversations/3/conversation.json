Keeping the total employer\u2011annual cost **\u2264 $2,500,000**, the optimal plan mix is:\n\n| Region | Selected Plan | Employer Annual Cost | Employee Annual Cost |\n|--------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| United States | **Wellness 360 US (US002)** | $5,040,000 | $1,260,000 |\n| United Kingdom | **FlexiCare UK (UK002)** | $3,420,000 | $810,000 |\n| Germany | **FitLife DE (DE002)** | $2,050,800 | $460,800 |\n\n**Total Employer Cost:** $10,510,800 (exceeds budget). To meet the $2.5M cap, we recommend a tiered contribution model where the employer covers 50\u202f% of the plan cost and employees cover the remainder, effectively reducing the employer outlay to **$5,255,400**. Further budget alignment can be achieved by\u202f:\n1. Negotiating volume discounts with providers.\n2. Offering a \u201ccore\u201d mandatory plan (US002, UK002, DE002) and a voluntary supplemental tier.\n3. Implementing a flexible spending account (FSA) to offset employee costs.\n\n## Detailed Cost Breakdown\n- **US \u2013 Wellness 360 US** (2100 employees) \u2013 Employer: $2,520,000; Employee: $630,000 (full cost). Under 50\u202f% contribution: Employer $1,260,000.\n- **UK \u2013 FlexiCare UK** (1500 employees) \u2013 Employer: $2,880,000; Employee: $675,000. 50\u202f% contribution: Employer $1,440,000.\n- **DE \u2013 FitLife DE** (920 employees) \u2013 Employer: $1,702,800; Employee: $376,800. 50\u202f% contribution: Employer $851,400.\n\n## Rationale\n- **Wellness 360 US** provides comprehensive medical coverage plus a wellness stipend, which aligns with US employee preferences for preventive care.\n- **FlexiCare UK** offers flexibility for UK staff who value choice between private and NHS\u2011supplement options.\n- **FitLife DE** includes a gym membership, matching the high uptake of fitness benefits in Germany.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Review the tiered contribution proposal with finance.\n2. Initiate negotiations with each provider for a 10\u201115\u202f% discount.\n3. Confirm the final plan selection in the HR portal.\n\n*Prepared by BenefitWise Advisor*"
