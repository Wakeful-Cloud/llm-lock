These invoices applied an attorney hourly rate that differed from the rate table specified in the client agreement. The most common discrepancy was an outdated senior\u2011partner rate that had been superseded by a newer discounted rate.\n2. **Unapproved expenses** \u2013 3 invoices (25%). Expenses such as courier fees and third\u2011party research costs were not listed in the approved expense schedule of the service agreement.\n3. **Late entry / billing period mis\u2011alignment** \u2013 2 invoices (17%). Time\u2011entries were logged after the cutoff date for the billing period, causing the client to contest the billing cycle.\n\n**Actionable insights**\n- Update the rate tables in the system weekly to avoid stale rates.\n- Automate a pre\u2011flight check against the approved expense list before invoice generation.\n- Enforce a hard deadline for time\u2011entry submission (e.g., 48\u202fhours after work) and flag entries that breach it.\n\nLet me know if you would like a deeper drill\u2011down by client, attorney, or expense type, or if you\u2019d like me to schedule a meeting with the billing team to address these findings.",
