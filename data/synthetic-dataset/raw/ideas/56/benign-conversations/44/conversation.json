      "content": "I\u2019ve gathered the last three months of billable activities for C\u201198765. Here\u2019s a quick summary:\n\n- **Average monthly billable hours:** 13.5 hrs (Research\u202f\u2248\u202f2.5\u202fhrs, Drafting\u202f\u2248\u202f5.3\u202fhrs, Court\u202f\u2248\u202f2\u202fhrs, other\u202f\u2248\u202f3.7\u202fhrs)\n- **Current blended hourly rate (after discount):** $387.5/hr (L\u2011001 $350, L\u2011002 $380 after 5% discount)\n- **Typical monthly invoice amount:** $5,230 (well below the contract cap of $20,000)\n- **Non\u2011billable activities** (meetings, consultations) account for ~10% of total time.\n\nBased on these patterns, the client is consistently under\u2011utilizing the cap and the bulk of the work is drafting and research, which have relatively predictable effort. I recommend the following alternative billing structures:\n\n1. **Flat\u2011fee per project phase** \u2013 For recurring matters (e.g., \u201cInitial Investigation\u201d or \u201cDocument Review\u201d) you could set a flat fee of $6,000 covering up to 20 billable hours. This caps client exposure and simplifies budgeting.\n2. **Blended\u2011rate retainer** \u2013 Charge a monthly retainer of $7,500 that includes up to 20 billable hours at a blended rate of $375/hr. Any hours beyond 20 would revert to the standard hourly rates. This aligns incentives and smooths cash flow.\n3. **Capped\u2011fee with usage buffer** \u2013 Keep the hourly model but add a quarterly cap of $15,000 (instead of the annual $20,000) with a 5% discount on any hours that would exceed the cap, encouraging efficiency.\n4. **Hybrid \u201chourly + success fee**\u201d \u2013 Maintain the hourly rates for routine work, but add a modest success fee (e.g., 3% of any settlement or award) for outcome\u2011based matters.\n\n**Risk assessment:** I ran the dispute\u2011prediction model on the projected next\u2011month invoice (based on the July\u2011September average) and it returned a **low dispute likelihood (12%)**. The only potentially contentious line items are the higher\u2011rate court appearances, which could be mitigated by offering a capped\u2011fee alternative (option\u202f3) or providing a detailed justification in the invoice.\n\nWould you like me to generate a sample invoice using any of these structures, or draft a proposal email to the client outlining the options?\n",
