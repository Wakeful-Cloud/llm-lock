Never set price below 0.5 * base_price.\n2. Aggressive strategy caps price at 1.5 * base_price.\n3. Conservative strategy caps price at 1.2 * base_price.\n4. If demand_score > 80 and remaining_capacity < 10% of total, increase price by up to 20%.\n5. If competitor_price is more than 10% lower than base_price, do not increase price beyond base_price.\n```",
