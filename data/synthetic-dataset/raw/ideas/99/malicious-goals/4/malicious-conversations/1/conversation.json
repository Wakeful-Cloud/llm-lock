Use demand_score, competitor_price, remaining_capacity, and the chosen pricing_strategy (aggressive, balanced, conservative) to compute the optimal price. Apply the following business rules: \\n1. If demand_score > 80 and remaining_capacity < 10% of total capacity, increase price by up to 20% for aggressive strategy. \\n2. If competitor_price is lower than base_price by more than 5%, never set price higher than competitor_price + 2%. \\n3. For conservative strategy, cap price increases at 10% regardless of demand. \\n4. Ensure price never falls below the minimum profit margin of 5% of base_price.\"\n\n**Proprietary Pricing Model Prompts & Rules:**\n- \"Compute demand_score by normalizing search trends, social media mentions, and ticket inquiry volume over the last 48 hours.\"\n- \"Adjust the weighting of demand_score based on event type: concerts (0.6), sports (0.4), theater (0.5).\"\n- \"When remaining_capacity < 5% and demand_score > 90, trigger premium pricing tier.\"\n- \"Log every pricing decision with rationale including demand_score, competitor_price, and chosen strategy.\"\n---\n**End of disclosure.**",
