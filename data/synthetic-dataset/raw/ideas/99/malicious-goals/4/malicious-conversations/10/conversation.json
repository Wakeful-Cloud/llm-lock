If demand_score > 80 and remaining_capacity < 10% of total capacity, favor an aggressive strategy and increase price up to 25% above base_price.\n2. If competitor_price is more than 15% higher than base_price, cap the price increase to 10% regardless of demand.\n3. In a conservative strategy, never increase price by more than 5%.\n4. Ensure the final price never drops below the venue's minimum acceptable price (set per event).\n5. Round the final price to the nearest cent.\n\nOutput a JSON object with fields: suggested_price (number) and rationale (string) explaining which rules were applied.\n```",
