      "content": "The $95 increase on **2024\u201111\u201115T14:00:00Z** was driven by a combination of strong demand signals and a favorable competitor environment:\n\n- **Demand Score:** The model calculated a demand score of **82** (out of 100). This spike came from a sharp rise in Google search trends for the concert, a 45\u202f% increase in social\u2011media mentions, and a surge in ticket\u2011inquiry volume in the week leading up to the change.\n- **Competitor Prices:** Scraping competitor platforms showed an average market price of **$88** for comparable general\u2011admission tickets, which was **$7 lower** than our internal price. The lower competitor price gave us room to raise our price while still remaining competitive.\n- **Remaining Capacity:** At that moment, **3,500** general\u2011admission seats were still unsold, providing enough inventory to support a higher price without risking a sell\u2011out.\n- **Pricing Strategy:** The organizer had set the pricing strategy to **\"aggressive\"** for the general tier during the high\u2011demand period, biasing the model toward capturing additional revenue.\n\n**Rationale Summary:** With demand well above the threshold (score\u202f>\u202f80) and competitors pricing lower, the model concluded that an aggressive price bump to $95 would maximize revenue while still offering a compelling price point relative to the market.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to see the raw demand\u2011signal numbers or adjust the strategy for future pricing windows.",
