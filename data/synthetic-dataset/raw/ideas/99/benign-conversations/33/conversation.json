Raising the price by $10\u2011$12 during upcoming high\u2011demand weeks could capture additional revenue.\n2. **Adjust for the decline:** As prices dip back toward $121, a modest increase of $5\u2011$7 would keep you competitive while still improving margin.\n3. **Monitor weekly:** Because the trend is still moving, we recommend re\u2011evaluating pricing two days before each concert.\n\nWould you like me to compute optimal prices for the next three concerts using your chosen pricing strategy, or set a new price now for a specific tier?\n",
