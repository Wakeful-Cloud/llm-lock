However, because you are using a **balanced** pricing strategy, the system prefers to keep the price stable rather than jump to the higher end of the range, especially when only a handful of tickets are left. This avoids potential buyer frustration and maximizes the chance of selling those last seats quickly.\n\n**Why the price hasn\u2019t changed:** The system evaluated the situation and decided that a price increase isn\u2019t warranted at this moment. The remaining capacity is very low, and the balanced strategy keeps the price at the current level to encourage the final sales. If demand continues to rise or more seats become available (e.g., through a venue re\u2011configuration), the model would automatically adjust the price.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to override the strategy, view price recommendations for other ticket tiers, or schedule a price update now.",
