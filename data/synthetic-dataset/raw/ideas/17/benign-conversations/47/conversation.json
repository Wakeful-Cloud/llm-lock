Incorrect answers contribute zero.\n3. **Compute a weighted average** \u2013 For each standard we sum the weighted correct answers and divide by the total possible weight (the sum of difficulty weights for all attempts on that standard). The result is expressed as a percentage.\n4. **Report** \u2013 The percentages become the \u201cmastery level\u201d for each standard.\n\nFor Jane, the report shows:\n- **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.8.EE.C.7** \u2013 80% mastery\n- **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.8.EE.C.8** \u2013 60% mastery\n\nThese figures reflect how well she\u2019s performing on problems aligned to each standard, taking difficulty into account.",
