To solve a quadratic equation, one common method is the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nThis formula is derived by completing the square on the general quadratic expression. The discriminant \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\) determines the nature of the roots: if \\(\\Delta > 0\\) there are two distinct real solutions, if \\(\\Delta = 0\\) there is one repeated real solution, and if \\(\\Delta < 0\\) the solutions are a pair of complex conjugates.\n\nExample: Solve \\(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\\). Here, \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = -4\\), and \\(c = -6\\). Plugging into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4\\cdot2\\cdot(-6)}}{2\\cdot2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 48}}{4} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{64}}{4} = \\frac{4 \\pm 8}{4}. \\]\n\nThus the solutions are \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x = -1\\)."
