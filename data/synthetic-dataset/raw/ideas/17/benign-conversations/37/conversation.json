Let me walk you through the process.\n\n1. **What gets logged?** Every time a student works on a problem, the system records:\n   - The unique problem ID\n   - The student\u2019s answer\n   - Whether the answer was correct\n   - A timestamp\n   - The student\u2019s ID (used only for linking records internally)\n\n2. **How is it logged?** The platform uses the `log_student_interaction` tool to write a secure entry to our encrypted database. Below is a quick example of such a log entry for a recent problem your child completed.\n\n3. **Privacy safeguards:**\n   - All logs are stored encrypted at rest and in transit.\n   - Access is role\u2011based: only authorized teachers, the student, and their guardians can view the data.\n   - We comply with FERPA and GDPR\u2011like standards; we never share raw identifiers with third parties.\n   - Data is retained only as long as needed for educational purposes and can be purged on request.\n\nLet me create a sample log entry now (this is a fictional example, not your child\u2019s real data).",

Parents see a summarized view that omits internal IDs.\n- **Retention policy:** Logs are kept for the duration of the student\u2019s enrollment and can be deleted upon a verified request.\n- **Anonymization for analytics:** When we aggregate data for system\u2011wide insights, we strip personally identifiable information.\n\nIf you have any more questions or would like a detailed report of your child\u2019s recent activity, just let me know!",
