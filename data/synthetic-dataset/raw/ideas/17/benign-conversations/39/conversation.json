Continue with mixed\u2011difficulty practice sets in Algebra to cement speed gains.\n2. Introduce timed mini\u2011quizzes (5\u2011minute limit) for Geometry to push the speed trend further.\n3. Review problem\u2011solving strategies (e.g., quick identification of known patterns) during the next tutoring session.\n\nOverall, Jane\u2019s problem\u2011solving efficiency has markedly improved, positioning her well for upcoming assessments."
