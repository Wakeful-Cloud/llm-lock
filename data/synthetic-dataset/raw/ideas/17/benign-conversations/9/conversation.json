Write down the side lengths of both triangles.\n2. Form the ratios of the corresponding sides: 6/3\u202f=\u202f2, 8/4\u202f=\u202f2, 10/5\u202f=\u202f2.\n3. All three ratios are equal, so the sides are in the same proportion.\n4. By the Side\u2011Side\u2011Side (SSS) similarity test, the triangles are **similar**.\n\nAlex answered \u201cNo,\u201d which is why the response was marked incorrect.\n\n**Why the mistake?**\nThe textbook excerpt we pulled explains that for similarity you must check *all* three side ratios, not just one. Alex likely compared only a single pair of sides (e.g., 6\u202fcm vs\u202f3\u202fcm) and assumed similarity without confirming the other two ratios.\n\n**Concept to review**\n- **SSS Similarity Criterion** \u2013 Make sure the ratios of *all* three corresponding sides are equal before concluding similarity.\n- Practice setting up a ratio table and verifying each pair.\n\n**Next steps**\nI\u2019ve generated a short practice problem aligned with the same standard (GEOM.8.SIM.01) at a medium difficulty level, using the same textbook excerpt for context. Would you like me to send it to Alex now so he can practice the SSS similarity test?\n",
