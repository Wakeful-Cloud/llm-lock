His English performance shows no notable misconceptions.\n\n**Recommendations**\n1. Assign extra practice problems focused on quadratic factoring, accompanied by detailed step\u2011by\u2011step solutions.\n2. Conduct a short review session on heat vs. temperature using everyday examples and simple lab activities.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you\u2019d like more practice problems on these topics or a deeper dive into any specific area.",
