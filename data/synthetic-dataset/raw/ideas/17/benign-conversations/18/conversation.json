As \\(x\\to0\\), both \\(\\cos x\\) and \\(1\\) converge to \\(1\\). By the Squeeze Theorem, the middle term also approaches \\(1\\).\n3. **Alternative proof using L\u2019H\u00f4pital\u2019s Rule.** Differentiate numerator and denominator: \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\sin x = \\cos x\\) and \\(\\frac{d}{dx}x = 1\\). Applying the rule gives \\(\\lim_{x\\to0}\\frac{\\cos x}{1}=\\cos 0 = 1\\).\n4. **Conclusion.** Both methods confirm that \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin x}{x}=1\\).\n\nEach algebraic manipulation follows directly from the Squeeze Theorem or L\u2019H\u00f4pital\u2019s Rule, which are part of the standard you are studying (MATH12.LIM.01).
