      "content": "Thanks for waiting. Here\u2019s how we calculate the difficulty rating for each subject:\n\n1. **Recent Quiz & Assignment Scores** \u2013 We look at the last 3\u20135 assessments for each standard (e.g., Algebra, Geometry). The scores are weighted (most recent\u202f=\u202f40%, earlier\u202f=\u202f30% each) to capture current performance trends.\n\n2. **Mastery Gaps** \u2013 From the learning\u2011management system we identify concepts where the student consistently scores below the mastery threshold (usually <\u202f70%). Each gap adds a penalty to the difficulty level for related problems.\n\n3. **Curriculum Standard Alignment** \u2013 Each practice problem is tied to a specific curriculum standard (e.g., CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.8.EE.A.1). The system knows the typical difficulty distribution for that standard across the grade.\n\n4. **Difficulty Mapping**:\n   - **Easy** \u2013 Weighted average \u2265\u202f85\u202f% **and** no active mastery gaps for the standard.\n   - **Medium** \u2013 Weighted average between\u202f70\u202f% and\u202f84\u202f% **or** one minor gap (e.g., a single sub\u2011topic just below 70\u202f%).\n   - **Hard** \u2013 Weighted average <\u202f70\u202f% **or** multiple/major gaps (such as the \"Quadratic equations\" gap you have in Math).\n\nUsing your child\u2019s data:\n- **Math**: Recent scores average to about 81\u202f% (Algebra\u202f85, Geometry\u202f78). The system also detected a gap in \"Quadratic equations,\" so new problems in that area are labeled **hard**, while other Math topics are **medium**.\n- **Science**: The average is 92\u202f% with no gaps, so all Science practice problems are currently marked **easy**.\n\nThese ratings are dynamic \u2013 they update automatically as new assessments are recorded, ensuring the practice you receive is always appropriately challenging.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can generate a sample practice problem for a specific Math topic at its current difficulty level, or provide a short progress report for the past 30 days.",
