The negative sign indicates opposite direction; speed is 2.14\u202fm/s.\nAnswer: Skater B moves at approximately 2.14\u202fm/s in the opposite direction.\nExplanation: The equal and opposite forces cause the two masses to acquire velocities inversely proportional to their masses, keeping total momentum zero.\""
