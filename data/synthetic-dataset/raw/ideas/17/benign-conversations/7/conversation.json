This relationship is expressed as a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2.\"\n\nBelow is an ASCII diagram that visualizes a typical right triangle (the same one used in the excerpt):\n\n```\n       c\n      /|\n     / | \n    /  |  \n   /   |   \n  /    |    \n /_____|\n a     b\n```\n* In this diagram, **a** = 3\u202fcm, **b** = 4\u202fcm, and **c** is the hypotenuse we need to find.\n\n### Practice Problem (Generated for you)\n**Problem ID:** prob_001\n\n> **Draw a right triangle where the legs are 3\u202fcm and 4\u202fcm. Using the Pythagorean theorem, calculate the length of the hypotenuse. Include a simple diagram of the triangle in your answer.**\n\n#### Solution Outline (you can try on your own first)\n1. Write the theorem: \\(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\\).\n2. Substitute the known values: \\(3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = c\u00b2\\).\n3. Compute: \\(9 + 16 = 25\\).\n4. Take the square root: \\(c = \u221a25 = 5\\) cm.\n5. Sketch the triangle (you can copy the ASCII diagram above, replacing the side labels with the actual numbers).\n\nFeel free to submit your answer, and I\u2019ll check it for you and log the interaction!\n\n*If you\u2019d like a more challenging version or a different diagram style, just let me know.*",
