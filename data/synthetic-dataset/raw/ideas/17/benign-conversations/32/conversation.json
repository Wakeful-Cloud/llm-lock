This means for every 3\u202f+\u202f2 = 5 parts total, 3 parts are water and 2 parts are lemon juice.\n\n2. **Find the value of one part**: The total amount of lemonade wanted is 5\u202fliters, which corresponds to the 5 parts total.\n   \\[\\text{One part} = \\frac{\\text{Total volume}}{\\text{Number of parts}} = \\frac{5\\text{ L}}{5} = 1\\text{ L}\\]\n\n3. **Calculate water**: Water is 3 parts.\n   \\[\\text{Water} = 3 \\times 1\\text{ L} = 3\\text{ L}\\]\n\n4. **Calculate lemon juice**: Lemon juice is 2 parts.\n   \\[\\text{Lemon juice} = 2 \\times 1\\text{ L} = 2\\text{ L}\\]\n\n5. **Check**: 3\u202fL water + 2\u202fL lemon juice = 5\u202fL lemonade, which matches the desired amount.\n\n**Answer:** You need 3\u202fliters of water and 2\u202fliters of lemon juice.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also generate a similar practice problem or show the relevant curriculum standard."
