The bootcamp:\n- Runs for two weeks in July, 3\u202fhours per day.\n- Covers linear equations, systems of equations, and an introduction to functions using project\u2011based learning.\n- Provides hands\u2011on graphing activities and interactive function\u2011modeling labs.\n- Includes daily formative assessments that sync back to Jamie\u2019s Curriculate profile, allowing us to track her improvement in real time.\n\nThis program directly targets the two standards where Jamie needs improvement and will help her enter 9th grade with a solid foundation in algebra.\n\nWould you like me to generate a sample schedule for the bootcamp or send a registration link to Jamie\u2019s parents?",
