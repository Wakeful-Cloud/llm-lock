The only thing to note is the justification for adding 9 (the \"+9\" comes from \\((b/2)^2\\)). Great job completing the square.\n\n**Next steps:**\n- Try a slightly harder problem with a leading coefficient not equal to 1, e.g., \\(2x^2 + 8x + 3 = 0\\).\n- Review the concept of \"completing the square\" in the textbook excerpt we used earlier.\n- I can generate a new practice problem for you now if you\u2019d like.\n\nWould you like another problem, or is there something else you\u2019d like to review?",
