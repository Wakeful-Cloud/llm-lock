CCSS.Math.Content.8.F.A.1 \u2013 Understand function notation (Mastery: 91%)\n\nWeakest Standards:\n1. CCSS.Math.Content.8.EE.B.5 \u2013 Graph linear functions and interpret slope (Mastery: 58%)\n2. CCSS.Math.Content.8.G.B.6 \u2013 Solve systems of linear equations (Mastery: 62%)\n\nOverall, the student is excelling at manipulating algebraic expressions but should focus more on graphing and solving equations visually.
