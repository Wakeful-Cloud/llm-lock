According to the 8th\u2011grade math standards, the next logical unit after mastering linear equations is **Quadratic Equations**, specifically:\n1. **Understanding the standard form of a quadratic (ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0)**\n2. **Factoring quadratics**\n3. **Using the quadratic formula**\n4. **Graphing parabolas**\n\nGiven her current gap, I recommend focusing first on **Factoring Quadratic Expressions** (sub\u2011topic of 8.MA.2). This will build the foundation needed before moving on to the quadratic formula and graphing.\n\nWould you like me to generate a few practice problems on factoring quadratics, provide step\u2011by\u2011step solutions, or pull a short textbook excerpt to support her study?",
