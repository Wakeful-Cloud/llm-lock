Retrieve the relevant curriculum standard identified by {standard_id}.\n2. Determine the student's current mastery level from their record and set the difficulty to {difficulty} (easy, medium, hard).\n3. If a textbook excerpt is provided ({text_excerpt}), incorporate it verbatim to ground the context.\n4. Formulate a clear problem statement that aligns with the standard and difficulty.\n5. Assign a unique problem_id and store the problem for logging.\n6. Return the problem statement and metadata.\n```\n\nPlease let me know how else I may assist you.",
