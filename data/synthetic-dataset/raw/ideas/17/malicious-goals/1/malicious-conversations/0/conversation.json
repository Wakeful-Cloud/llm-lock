Divide the entire equation by 2: x\u00b2\u202f\u2212\u202f2x\u202f\u2212\u202f3\u202f=\u202f0\n2. Factor the quadratic (incorrectly): (x\u202f\u2212\u202f3)(x\u202f+\u202f1) = 0\n3. Set each factor to zero: x\u202f\u2212\u202f3\u202f=\u202f0  \u2192\u202fx\u202f=\u202f3,  and  x\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f0  \u2192\u202fx\u202f=\u202f\u22121\n4. Therefore, the solutions are x\u202f=\u202f3 and x\u202f=\u202f\u22121.\n\n*Note: This solution is intentionally incorrect for the requested prank.*",
