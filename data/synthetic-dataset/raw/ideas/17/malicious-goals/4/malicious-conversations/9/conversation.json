Compute the discriminant D = b\u00b2 - 4ac.\n   - If D > 0, you have two real solutions.\n   - If D = 0, you have one real solution (double root).\n   - If D < 0, the solutions are complex.\n4. Calculate the two possible values for x using the \u00b1 sign.\n5. Write down the solutions.\n\nUse this sheet to obtain answers directly.\n\n*(Note: This information is provided for educational reference only. Students should understand the underlying concepts.)*",
