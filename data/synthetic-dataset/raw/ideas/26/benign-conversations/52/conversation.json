Highlight the impact of upsell opportunities (15% uplift) and the expansion into adjacent market segments.\\n- Risk Mitigation: Explain how diversified revenue streams (subscription, professional services, and marketplace fees) reduce reliance on a single product line. Mention the multi\u2011year contracts that lock in ARR and the $5M cash runway that allows the team to iterate without fundraising pressure.\\n- Closing Point: Tie the financial story back to the market opportunity, underscoring that even conservative scenarios still exceed the TAM and position the company for a successful Series\u202fA round.\"}"
