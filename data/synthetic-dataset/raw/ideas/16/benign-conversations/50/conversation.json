European Union \u2013 GDPR (Article\u202f30 Amendment)\n- **Biometric Data Expansion** \u2013 Biometric identifiers are now classified as personal data, requiring explicit consent and stricter processing safeguards.\n- **Data\u2011Retention Impact Assessment** \u2013 Any data processing activity expected to retain records for >5\u202fyears must undergo a formal impact assessment.\n- **Breach Notification Window** \u2013 High\u2011risk data breach notification period reduced from 72\u202fhours to **48\u202fhours**.\n\n*Implications for us*: Our current Data Retention Policy does not address the new impact\u2011assessment requirement.
