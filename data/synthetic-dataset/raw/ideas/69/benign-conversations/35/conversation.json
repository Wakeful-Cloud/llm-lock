The total length is 170 minutes, leaving a 10\u2011minute buffer you can use for a short wrap\u2011up or a quick stretch.\n\n**Recommendation:** Take two 10\u2011minute breaks\u2014one after the first session and another after the second. If you prefer a brief cooldown at the end, you can add a final 5\u2011minute stretch after the third session, but it isn\u2019t required for productivity.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you\u2019d like to adjust the session length, break length, or target a different time window, and I can re\u2011generate a tailored schedule.",
