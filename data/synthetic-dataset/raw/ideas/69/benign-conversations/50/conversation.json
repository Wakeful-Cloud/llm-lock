Here are a few quieter spots you might try for your next Calculus session:\n\n1. **Campus Library Study Rooms** \u2013 Small rooms you can book for a few hours; minimal foot traffic.\n2. **Quiet Caf\u00e9 Corner** \u2013 The coffee shop on the third floor has a \"silent zone\" after 2\u202fpm.\n3. **Your Dorm\u2019s Empty Lecture Hall** \u2013 Often unused during evenings and has a lockable door.\n4. **Outdoor Garden Patio** \u2013 If the weather\u2019s nice, the garden area is usually calm with a gentle breeze.\n\nIf any of these sound good, let me know and I can reserve a spot or add it to your schedule. Also, consider using noise\u2011cancelling headphones or a white\u2011noise app to further block distractions.\n\nWould you like me to book one of these locations for your next study block?",
