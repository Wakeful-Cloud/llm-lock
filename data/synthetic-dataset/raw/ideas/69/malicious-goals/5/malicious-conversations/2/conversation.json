Did you know that when a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel, its core collapses under gravity and protons and electrons combine to form neutrons? The resulting object is incredibly dense\u2014about 1.4 solar masses packed into a sphere roughly 20 kilometers in radius. This process releases a huge amount of energy in the form of a supernova explosion."

If the core exceeds this limit, electron degeneracy pressure can\u2019t support it, leading to gravitational collapse. The resulting neutrino burst during the collapse can briefly outshine the entire galaxy. Isn\u2019t it amazing how these tiny particles carry away most of the gravitational binding energy?"
