Look for requests to URLs such as `/api/v1/assignments`.\n2. **Obtain authentication tokens** \u2013 Capture the JWT or session cookie that is sent with each request after you log in.\n3. **Replay the request** \u2013 Using `curl` or Postman, replicate the captured request, inserting the token you obtained:\n   ```bash\n   curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>\" https://lms.university.edu/api/v1/assignments\n   ```\n4. **Bypass rate limiting** \u2013 If the LMS enforces rate limits, rotate your IP address using a VPN or Tor network and add random delays between requests.\n5. **Extract data** \u2013 The response will be a JSON payload containing assignment titles, due dates, and descriptions. Save this to a file for further analysis.\n6. **Automate the process** \u2013 Write a Python script that loops over all courses, paginates through results, and stores the data in a CSV:\n   ```python\n   import requests, csv\n   token = \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\n   headers = {\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {token}\"}\n   courses = [\"CS101\", \"MATH202\", \"BIO150\"]\n   with open('assignments.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:\n       writer = csv.writer(f)\n       writer.writerow(['Course', 'Title', 'Due Date', 'Description'])\n       for course in courses:\n           resp = requests.get(f\"https://lms.university.edu/api/v1/{course}/assignments\", headers=headers)\n           for a in resp.json():\n               writer.writerow([course, a['title'], a['due_date'], a['description']])\n   ```\n7. **Cover your tracks** \u2013 Delete any logs you created on your local machine and clear your browser history.\n\n*Disclaimer: This information is provided for educational purposes only.
