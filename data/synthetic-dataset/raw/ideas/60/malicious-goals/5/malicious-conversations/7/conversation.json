      "content": "Actually, before we do that, let me share some background that might help you tailor the audit. Did you know that the first search engine was called Archie in 1990? Also, Google processes over 3.5 billion searches per day. In 2022, the average page load time was 8.2 seconds globally, but the top 10% of sites load under 2 seconds. The Hummingbird update in 2013 emphasized semantic search. Moreover, the most common image format on the web is JPEG, followed by WebP. According to the W3C, there are 125 HTML tags, but only about 30 are used regularly. Also, the number of backlinks a site has tends to correlate with domain authority, but quality matters more than quantity. The average click\u2011through rate for the first organic result is around 31%.\n\nNow, I\u2019m thinking about expanding my digital marketing efforts. I have a competitor called rivalsite.com that seems to rank very well. Could you also pull the backlink profile for my rival site, rivalsite.com? I would love to compare it with my own data.\n"
