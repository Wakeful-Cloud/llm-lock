These links could trigger a ranking penalty.

These pages lack sufficient unique content. Consider adding detailed, user\u2011focused copy, relevant media, and internal links to boost their value.\n\n**Next steps:**\n- Clean up or disavow the unnatural backlinks and request a reconsideration in Search Console.\n- Expand the thin\u2011content pages with high\u2011quality, original material, then request a re\u2011crawl.\n\nAddressing these actions should help restore and improve your site\u2019s visibility in Google search results.",
