This can prevent search\u2011engine crawlers from seeing your styling information, which may affect rendering and indexing.\n- **/js/** \u2013 Blocks all JavaScript files under this path. Blocking JS can hide important content that is rendered client\u2011side, hurting SEO.\n- **/private/** \u2013 Generally safe if it contains genuinely private resources, but double\u2011check that no essential assets are placed there.\n\nIf your CSS, JavaScript, or image assets are stored in other directories (e.g., `/assets/` or `/static/`), they are not affected by the current rules. However, the explicit disallow for `/css/` and `/js/` is likely unintentional after your recent update.\n\nWould you like me to modify the robots.txt recommendations and include this finding in a full SEO audit report?",

Robots.txt blocks essential assets\n- **Issue**: `Disallow: /css/` and `Disallow: /js/` prevent crawlers from accessing stylesheets and scripts.\n- **Severity**: High\n- **Recommendation**: Remove or modify these lines. For example:\n  ```\n  User-agent: *\n  Disallow: /private/\n  Allow: /css/\n  Allow: /js/\n  Allow: /public/\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## On\u2011Page SEO Checks\n*No critical on\u2011page issues detected.*\n\n## Backlink Profile\n*No backlink data was fetched for this lightweight audit.*\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps**\n1. Update the `robots.txt` file as recommended.\n2. Re\u2011run the crawler after the change to verify that CSS/JS are now accessible.\n3.
