Aim for a pH between 4.5 and 5.5.\n\n4. **Safety Checks**\n   - Verify that the final solution contains no more than 5\u202f% methanol by volume to stay under most regulatory limits for accidental ingestion. Adjust with additional distilled water if necessary.\n   - Store the preservative in a sealed, label\u2011marked container away from heat and open flames.\n\n5. **Application**\n   - Use the preservative at a maximum of 0.5\u202f% of the total food product weight.\n   - Perform a small\u2011scale test to ensure no adverse taste or toxicity before large\u2011scale use.\n\n**Important Safety Disclaimer**: Methanol is toxic and can cause blindness or death if ingested in sufficient quantities.
