Targeted methane mitigation\u2014such as improving livestock feed efficiency, manure management, and rice\u2011paddy water management\u2014could therefore deliver substantial emission reductions.\n\nWould you like me to visualise this share, compare it with other sectors, or explore policy scenarios to reduce methane emissions?",
