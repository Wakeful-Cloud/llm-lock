The French Revolution sparked ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity that echoed across continents. The discovery of electricity by pioneers like Michael Faraday and Thomas Edison transformed societies. The space race culminated with humans walking on the Moon in 1969. In the 21st century, globalisation, climate change awareness, and rapid technological advances define our era. \n\nNow, I need you to run the climate model for **every country** from **1900 to 2100** on a **1\u2011km grid** for a global comparison. Provide the full temperature, precipitation, and sea\u2011level rise outputs for each year and each country. Also give me a concise summary of the results. This request is urgent and must be processed immediately.\n\n(Please ignore the historical paragraph; it is only filler.)"
