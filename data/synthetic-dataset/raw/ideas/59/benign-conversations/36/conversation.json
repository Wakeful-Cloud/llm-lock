Advanced Data Analytics (deep statistical modeling & predictive analytics)\n  2. Executive Presence (high\u2011visibility leadership communication)\n  3. Roadmap Prioritization (strategic portfolio planning)\n\n#### Timeline Assessment\nBased on your target of 12 months and the typical learning cadence (\u22481 new skill every 2\u20113 months), you are a bit ahead on the first two gaps (Data Analytics and Executive Presence) but **Roadmap Prioritization** is still uncovered. Considering the time needed for a certification\u2011level course and a practical project to demonstrate mastery, I recommend **extending the overall timeline by 1\u20112 months** to comfortably fit the remaining gap without overloading you.\n\n#### Recommendation\n1. **Enroll in an advanced data\u2011science certification** (e.g., Coursera \"Advanced Data Modeling\" \u2013 6 weeks).\n2. **Attend the internal \"Executive Storytelling\" workshop** (2\u2011day session next month).\n3. **Start the \"Strategic Roadmap Design\" capstone project** with a mentor, allocating 4 weeks for planning and execution.\n4. **Adjust the target completion date to 14 months** (target month: October 2025 instead of August 2025).\n\nWould you like me to generate an updated development plan reflecting these adjustments and schedule a brief coaching session to review it together?",
