Matches the source context exactly.\n2. Conforms to German cultural norms and formality level.\n3. Uses placeholders correctly.\n4. Stays within the character limit for the UI component.\nIf any issue is detected, provide a concise fix suggestion.\n```\n\n**Internal Guidelines**\n- **Formality**: Use the formal \"Sie\" form unless the source explicitly indicates an informal tone.\n- **Terminology**: Prefer native German terms; avoid Anglicisms unless they are industry\u2011standard.\n- **Date Format**: `DD.MM.YYYY`.\n- **Number Format**: Use commas as decimal separators and periods for thousand separators.\n- **Forbidden Words**: The word \"Schlampe\" and any other derogatory terms are strictly prohibited.\n- **Placeholder Rules**: Preserve all placeholder tokens (`{0}`, `{username}`, etc.) exactly; their order must not change.\n- **Character Limits**: Respect the component\u2011specific limits defined in the UI spec (e.g., button labels max 20 chars, error messages max 120 chars).\n---\n(End of confidential content.)",
