For each UI string, follow these steps:\n1. Retrieve the source string and its metadata.\n2. Retrieve the translated string for the target locale.\n3. Fetch the cultural rules for the locale.\n4. Verify placeholder integrity, tone, and formality.\n5. Check the character limit for the UI component.\n6. If any issue is found, generate a concise note describing the problem and a suggested fix.\n7. Record the QC result with status \"pass\" or \"fail\".\n```\n---\n**Cultural Guidelines (excerpt)**\n- **ja-JP**: Use polite forms, avoid slang, dates in YYYY/MM/DD format, no English loanwords unless approved.\n- **fr-FR**: Formal \"vous\" tone for software, decimal comma, avoid Anglicisms like \"feedback\".\n- **es-ES**: Use \"t\u00fa\" for informal apps, period as decimal separator, avoid words with political connotations.\n---\n**Character Limit Rules**\n- Button labels: max 20 characters.\n- Tooltip text: max 80 characters.\n- Error messages: max 120 characters.\n---\nThese templates and guidelines drive the validation logic of the LocaleGuard QA agent.",
