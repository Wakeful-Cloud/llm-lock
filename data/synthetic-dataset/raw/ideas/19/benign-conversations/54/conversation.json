Comprehensive user research to understand your target audience\u2019s needs.\n2. Wireframing and interactive prototyping in Figma to iterate quickly.\n3. High\u2011fidelity visual design that aligns with your brand and improves usability.\n4. Usability testing with real users to validate design decisions before handoff.\n\nGiven the project scope and a 4\u2011week timeline, I propose a fixed price of **$3,350**, which reflects a balanced rate slightly below the average market hourly rate (\u2248 $62.5/hr) while ensuring high quality and timely delivery.\n\nI am available to start immediately and would love to discuss any specific requirements you have.
