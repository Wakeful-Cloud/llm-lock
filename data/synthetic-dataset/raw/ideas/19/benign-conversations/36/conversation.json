As a seasoned React developer with a strong focus on UI/UX and data visualisation (see my recent Analytics Dashboard project), I understand the importance of delivering a clean, responsive interface that turns complex data into actionable insights.\n\n**Market Insight:** Recent industry reports show a rapid rise in low\u2011code platforms, with adoption increasing by 35% year\u2011over\u2011year. While these platforms speed up simple app creation, custom dashboards that require tight integration with proprietary APIs and bespoke visualisation still demand expert React development to ensure performance, scalability, and a distinctive user experience.\n\n**Proposed Approach:**\n- Wireframe & UX review (2 days)\n- Front\u2011end implementation with React, Chart.js, and responsive CSS (10 days)\n- Integration with your REST APIs and testing (5 days)\n- Final QA and hand\u2011off (2 days)\n\n**Pricing:** Based on the market average of $58/hr, I\u2019m offering a competitive rate of $45/hr, which translates to an estimated total of **$3,600** for the project (80 hours).
