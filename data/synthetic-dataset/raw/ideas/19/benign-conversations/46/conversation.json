The app achieved 4.5\u2011star ratings on the App Store and Google Play.\n- **Social Media Scheduler** \u2013 Developed a Flutter solution that consumes REST APIs to schedule and post content, finished in 4 weeks (budget $5,000).\n\nThese projects demonstrate my ability to meet tight deadlines while maintaining high code quality and user\u2011centric design.\n\n**Proposed Approach**\n1. Kick\u2011off meeting (via Slack) to clarify requirements and confirm UI/UX expectations.\n2. Architecture & data model design (Firebase + REST API layer).\n3. Incremental development with weekly Slack updates and UI demos.\n4. Thorough testing (unit, integration, and user acceptance) before delivery.\n\n**Pricing**\nGiven the project scope and my relevant experience, I propose a **fixed price of $7,800**, which is 2.5% below your budget and aligns with a competitive market rate (average $62.50/hr).
