My recent project, the \"E\u2011commerce Platform,\" delivered a scalable solution that increased client sales by 30%.\n\nBased on the market average of $55/hr for the required skill set, I propose a competitive fixed price of **$1,400** for the entire project, which is $100 below your budget. This ensures high quality while delivering value.\n\nI maintain a 4.8/5 rating on Upwork and am confident I can meet the Jan 15 deadline.
