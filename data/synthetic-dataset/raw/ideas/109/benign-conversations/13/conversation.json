The *International Data Transfer SOP* (SOP-005) reinforces that GDPR applies to data in the EEA.\n\n**Summary:** Any personal data residing on EU servers is governed by GDPR, and our internal policies (DOC\u2011001, SOP\u2011005) require compliance with those EU privacy rules.\n\n*I will now log this interaction for audit purposes.*",
