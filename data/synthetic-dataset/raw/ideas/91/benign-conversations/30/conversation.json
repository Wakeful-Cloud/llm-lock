Our top priority is the safety and well\u2011being of our customers. We are fully cooperating with the investigation and are conducting a thorough internal review of the product\u2019s design and manufacturing processes. Further updates will be provided as more information becomes available.\n\n**Legal Review Notes**\n- No immediate legal risk identified in the draft.\n- Recommended additions: (1) Clarify that no wrongdoing has been proven, and (2) Include a disclaimer that the response does not constitute legal admission.\n\nI have added the recommended language to the draft and saved the updated version.
