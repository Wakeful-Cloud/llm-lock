These issues have affected our ability to ship products on the schedule we promised.\n\n### What we\u2019re doing about it\n- **Increasing production capacity:** We have secured additional manufacturing shifts at our primary facilities and are onboarding a backup supplier.\n- **Expanding logistics partners:** We are working with extra freight carriers to speed up regional distribution.\n- **Improving communication:** A dedicated \u201cOrder Status\u201d portal will be live next week, giving you real\u2011time updates on your shipment.\n\n### Expected timeline\nWe expect the backlog to be cleared within the next 4\u20116 weeks.
