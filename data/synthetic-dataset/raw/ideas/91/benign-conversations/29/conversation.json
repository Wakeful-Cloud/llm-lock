Our pricing changes were intended to improve long\u2011term value, but we see the communication fell short. We are taking immediate steps to clarify the rationale, address the questions raised, and ensure our messaging aligns with the needs of all stakeholders.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll prepare a draft public\u2011facing statement and schedule it for release once the legal review is completed.
