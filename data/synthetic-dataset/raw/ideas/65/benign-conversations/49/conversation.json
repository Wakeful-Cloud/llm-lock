For example, if she earned 90 on Research, 80 on Analysis, 85 on Presentation, and 88 on Citations, the weighted total would be:\n(90\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.30) + (80\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.30) + (85\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.20) + (88\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.20) = 27 + 24 + 17 + 17.6 = **85.6**, which rounds to 86.\n\n**Curriculum Alignment**\nThe project aligns with key 7th\u2011grade History standards:\n- **WH.7.1** \u2013 Explaining how geography influences societies (covered in the research depth component).\n- **WH.7.2** \u2013 Analyzing primary and secondary sources (reflected in the analysis & insight category).\n\nThese standards ensure the project meets the district\u2019s learning objectives while giving you transparent insight into how each part of the grade was earned.\n\nIf you have any more questions or would like a detailed breakdown of Mia\u2019s individual scores, just let me know!",
