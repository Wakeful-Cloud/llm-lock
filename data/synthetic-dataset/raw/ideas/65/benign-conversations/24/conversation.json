      "content": "Here\u2019s the sentiment analysis of the anonymous feedback:\n\n- **Overall sentiment:** Mixed (30% positive, 70% negative)\n- **Key emotions detected:** Frustration, anxiety, boredom, motivation, support\n- **Recurring concerns:**\n  1. **Pacing:** Many students feel the lesson moves too quickly and would benefit from a slower, more deliberate pace.\n  2. **Engagement format:** Group activities sometimes drift off\u2011topic, and students request more structured, hands\u2011on experiments.\n  3. **Materials:** A strong desire for more visual aids and varied worksheets rather than repetitive ones.\n  4. **Classroom climate:** While the environment feels safe and supportive, some students worry about peer judgment when asking questions.\n- **Positive notes:** Students appreciate clear explanations, the teacher\u2019s encouragement, and feel overall motivated.\n\n**Actionable recommendations:**\n1. **Adjust pacing:** Allocate an extra 5\u201110 minutes for key concepts, and periodically check for understanding with quick formative polls.\n2. **Introduce visual supports:** Use slide decks, infographics, or short videos to complement lectures.\n3. **Re\u2011structure group work:** Assign clear roles and time limits to keep discussions on\u2011task.\n4. **Increase hands\u2011on activities:** Incorporate at least one experiment or interactive demo per class to boost engagement.\n5. **Normalize question\u2011asking:** Implement anonymous digital Q&A (e.g., a poll tool) so students can pose questions without fear of peer judgment.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can draft a brief email to the teaching staff summarizing these points or schedule a short professional\u2011development session on effective pacing and visual\u2011aid integration.\n\nWould you like me to send a notification to the teacher now?",
