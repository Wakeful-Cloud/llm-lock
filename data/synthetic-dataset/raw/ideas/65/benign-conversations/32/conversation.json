Many confused the difference between factoring by grouping versus using the quadratic formula.\n2. **Solving Linear Equations (Q2)** \u2013 45% correct. Common errors involved mishandling variables on both sides and incorrect sign changes.\n3. **Order of Operations (Q1)** \u2013 while 85% got it right, the remaining 15% showed recurring mistakes with parentheses and exponent precedence, indicating a lingering gap.\n\nYou might consider a short review session on factoring techniques, followed by targeted practice on linear equation manipulation, and a quick refresher activity on PEMDAS to close the remaining gaps.",
