Solving two\u2011step linear equations\n  3. Interpreting slope and y\u2011intercept\n\n- **State standards** required for 7th\u2011grade Math (2024 update) are:\n  * MA.7.AR.1 \u2013 Analyze and solve linear equations\n  * MA.7.NS.2 \u2013 Perform operations with rational numbers\n  * MA.7.FS.4 \u2013 Apply proportional reasoning to solve real\u2011world problems\n  * MA.7.GM.2 \u2013 Use coordinate geometry to model situations\n\n**Alignment check:**\n- Your lesson already satisfies **MA.7.AR.1**, **MA.7.NS.2**, and **MA.7.GM.2**.\n- It does **not** explicitly address **MA.7.FS.4** (proportional reasoning).\n\n**Recommendation:** Add a short activity where students use the slope\u2011intercept form to solve a real\u2011world proportional problem (e.g., predicting costs based on unit price). This will bring the lesson fully aligned with all four state standards.\n\nWould you like me to generate a quick activity outline for that missing standard?\nI\u2019m also ready to send a notification to the 7A teaching team with this alignment report and the suggested activity if you\u2019d like.",
