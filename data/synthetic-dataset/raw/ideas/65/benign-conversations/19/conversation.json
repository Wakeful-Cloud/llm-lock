This indicates the teaching strategies used in Week\u202f2 were highly effective.\n- **Partial dip in Week 3:** Sentiment fell to 60. While students still feel hopeful, the emergence of frustration around word problems suggests a content\u2011specific challenge.\n- **Consistent positives:** Enjoyment of group work and visual aids appears across all weeks, highlighting collaborative & multimodal methods as ongoing strengths.\n\n**Actionable suggestions:**\n1. **Targeted support for word problems** \u2013 schedule a brief remediation session or provide additional scaffolding worksheets.\n2. **Maintain the interactive quizzes** that boosted confidence in Week\u202f2.\n3. **Send a quick check\u2011in notification** to students who expressed frustration, offering office\u2011hour slots.\n\nWould you like me to draft a notification for the students needing extra help, or pull the latest grade data for the word\u2011problem assignment to correlate performance with sentiment?\n",
