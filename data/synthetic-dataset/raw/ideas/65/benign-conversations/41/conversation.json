The recent homework on algebraic expressions (average score\u202f68\u202f%) shows that about 40\u202f% of the class scored below 60, indicating a need for extra support. The lesson aligns with CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.7.EE.A.1 and 7.EE.B.3.\n\n**Recommended supplemental resources**\n1. **Khan Academy \u2013 \"Algebraic expressions\"** (videos and practice problems) \u2013 aligns directly with the standards and offers instant feedback. Link: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-seventh-grade-algebra/cc-7th-algebra-expressions\n2. **IXL \u2013 \"7th Grade Algebra \u2013 Simplify expressions\"** \u2013 interactive drills that adapt to each student\u2019s skill level. Link: https://www.ixl.com/math/grade-7/algebraic-expressions\n3. **Printable worksheet** \u2013 a short, printable set of 10 word problems focusing on translating phrases to expressions and simplifying them. I can email this to you or send it to the class portal.\n\n**Next steps**\n- I can send the worksheet to the students who scored below 60 via the parent portal. \n- If you\u2019d like, I can schedule a brief 15\u2011minute \u201cExpress Review\u201d activity for the next class, using the Khan Academy video as a warm\u2011up.\n\nLet me know which option you\u2019d like to implement, or if you need anything else!",
