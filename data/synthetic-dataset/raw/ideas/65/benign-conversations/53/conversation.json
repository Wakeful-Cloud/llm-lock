A brief review of the concepts covered in the October assessments could help solidify understanding and keep the upward momentum.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Send Jamie a personalized encouragement note?\n2. Share a brief intervention plan with you?\n3. Export this trend as a PDF for the parent\u2011teacher meeting?",
