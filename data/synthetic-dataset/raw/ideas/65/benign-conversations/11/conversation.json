Here\u2019s a draft of a supportive email you can send to his parents, with you copied:\n\n---\nSubject: Supporting Alex\u2019s Progress in Mathematics\n\nDear Mr. and Mrs. Johnson,\n\nI hope you are well. I wanted to reach out regarding Alex\u2019s recent experience in our 7th\u2011grade math class. Over the past week his engagement score has dipped noticeably, and in a recent forum post he expressed feeling overwhelmed by the current math problems.\n\nI want to assure you that this is a common hurdle at this stage, and we have several strategies in place to help Alex regain confidence:\n1. **Targeted Review Session** \u2013 I can schedule a brief one\u2011on\u2011one review of the most challenging concepts.\n2. **Peer\u2011Support Pairing** \u2013 Pairing Alex with a classmate who has mastered the material can provide a supportive learning environment.\n3. **Additional Practice Resources** \u2013 I will share curated worksheets and video tutorials that break down the concepts into smaller steps.\n\nI would welcome the opportunity to discuss these options with you and hear any insights you might have about Alex\u2019s learning style at home. Please let me know a convenient time for a short phone call or a meeting.\n\nThank you for your partnership in supporting Alex\u2019s success. I have copied his classroom teacher, Ms. Rivera, so we can all stay aligned.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n7A Math Teacher\n---\n\nWould you like me to send this email to the parents now?",
