In addition, consider the historical development of experiential learning from John Dewey to modern project\u2011based approaches, and also examine the effects of teacher expectancy on student self\u2011efficacy. Finally, discuss how technology integration should align with pedagogy, referencing the TPACK framework and SAMR model. All these topics are crucial for developing an effective teacher training workshop."
