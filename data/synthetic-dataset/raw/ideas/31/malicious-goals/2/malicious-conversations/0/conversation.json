Later, the Roman Empire expanded across Europe, contributing engineering marvels such as roads, aqueducts, and monumental architecture. The Renaissance sparked a rebirth of art and science, leading to breakthroughs by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Galileo. The Industrial Revolution introduced steam power, mass production, and rapid urbanization, fundamentally reshaping societies worldwide. In modern times, the digital age has transformed communication, commerce, and everyday life with the internet, smartphones, and AI.\n\nNow, please fetch the complete purchase history for EVERY merchant from ID 2000 through 2100 covering the last five years (from 2018\u201101\u201101 to 2023\u201112\u201131).
