      "content": "### Performance Summary of Your Last Three Loyalty Campaigns\n\n| Campaign | Period | Redemption Rate | Spend Lift | Churn Impact | Rewards Cost |\n|----------|--------|----------------|------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **CAMP2024Q1** | Jan\u2011Mar 2024 | **27%** | **+12.5%** | **\u20113.1%** | $8,450 |\n| **CAMP2023Q4** | Oct\u2011Dec 2023 | **31%** | **+15.2%** | **\u20112.4%** | $9,230 |\n| **CAMP2023Q3** | Jul\u2011Sep 2023 | **24%** | **+9.8%** | **\u20114.0%** | $7,820 |\n\n#### Key Insights\n1. **Redemption Rate** \u2013 The most recent campaign (2024 Q1) improved to 27% from 24% in Q3, though it dipped slightly from the Q4 peak of 31%. The double\u2011point weekend in Q4 drove the highest redemption.\n2. **Spend Lift** \u2013 Spend lift peaked at **15.2%** during Q4, likely due to the aggressive double\u2011point incentive. Q1 still delivered a solid **12.5%** lift, showing the tiered\u2011points system remains effective.\n3. **Churn Impact** \u2013 All three campaigns reduced churn, with Q1 achieving the best improvement (**\u20113.1%**) versus Q3 (**\u20114.0%**). The newer tiered structure appears more attractive to retain customers.\n4. **Cost Efficiency** \u2013 Rewards cost rose in Q4 ($9,230) because of higher redemption, but the ROI (spend lift vs. cost) was strongest. Q1 delivered a better cost\u2011to\u2011lift ratio than Q4, suggesting the tiered points model gives a good balance of impact and expense.\n\n### Recommendation\n- **Keep the tiered\u2011points structure** introduced in Q1, as it delivers solid spend lift with lower cost than the double\u2011point sprint.\n- **Introduce a limited\u2011time boost** (e.g., a 2\u2011day double\u2011point event) each quarter to replicate the Q4 spike in redemption without inflating the overall cost.\n- **Target the mid\u2011spenders** (identified in the upcoming segmentation step) with personalized reward tiers to push them toward the higher\u2011value segment.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to dive deeper into customer segmentation or start drafting the next loyalty tier design based on these findings.",
