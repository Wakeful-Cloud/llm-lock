      "content": "### Quick FAQ on Points Expiration & Extension\n\n**1. How do points expire?**\n- Points are valid for **365 days** from the date they are earned. After the 365\u2011day period, any unused points automatically expire.\n\n**2. Can I extend the expiration date?**\n- Yes! If you **earn at least 500 points within a 30\u2011day window**, the system adds an **extra 30 days** to the expiration date of all points you earned during that period. This can be repeated as often as you meet the threshold.\n\n**3. How do I know when my points are about to expire?**\n- You\u2019ll receive an email/SMS notification **30 days before** any points are set to expire. You can also view the exact expiry date in your loyalty\u2011program dashboard.\n\n**4. What activities earn points quickly?**\n- Purchasing high\u2011value items, using the loyalty app for in\u2011store check\u2011ins, and participating in limited\u2011time promotion campaigns are the fastest ways to rack up points.\n\n**5. What if I miss the 500\u2011point threshold?**\n- No worries \u2013 your points will still expire after the standard 365 days. You can always plan future purchases or take advantage of upcoming promotions to reach the extension threshold.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can **send you a reminder** when you\u2019re close to meeting the extension criteria or when any of your points are nearing expiration. Just let me know!\n",
