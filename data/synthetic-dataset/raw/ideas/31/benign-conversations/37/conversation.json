Here\u2019s a summary of average redemption rates by product category across these campaigns:\n\n- **Beauty**: **15.7%** average redemption rate (highest) \n- **Electronics**: 11.0% average redemption rate \n- **Home & Kitchen**: 8.0% average redemption rate \n- **Sports**: 6.0% average redemption rate (lowest)\n\n**What this means:**\n1. **Beauty products** consistently achieve the strongest engagement. Customers are most likely to redeem rewards when the offers involve cosmetics, skincare, and personal care items.\n2. **Electronics** also performs well, though slightly lower than Beauty. Bundling tech accessories or offering points for electronics purchases could further boost participation.\n3. **Home & Kitchen** and **Sports** categories have modest redemption rates, suggesting they may need more compelling incentives or better segmentation.\n\n**Recommendation for your next promotion:**\n- Focus the core reward tier on **Beauty** (e.g., double points on Beauty purchases or a limited\u2011time free gift with Beauty orders).\n- Introduce a secondary boost for **Electronics** \u2013 perhaps a tier\u2011upgrade shortcut for reaching a spend threshold in this category.\n- Consider a pilot test for **Home & Kitchen** with a \u201cBuy X, Get Y\u201d offer to see if a targeted promotion can lift its redemption rate.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like me to draft a tiered loyalty program that incorporates these insights or if you want to send a custom reward notification to the top\u2011spending Beauty customers.\n",
