A higher rate indicates that the rewards are valuable and that the program drives engagement.\n2. **Spend Lift** \u2013 The incremental increase in average order value or total spend from members versus non\u2011members (observed lift of 11\u201118%). This shows whether the program encourages higher spending.\n3. **Repeat\u2011Purchase Frequency** \u2013 While not directly returned by the tool, we can compute it from purchase data. It measures how often members make a subsequent purchase within 30\u202fdays of a reward redemption. In past campaigns, higher redemption rates correlated with a 20\u201130% boost in repeat\u2011purchase frequency.\n\nTracking these KPIs weekly will let you spot early signs of program traction (or issues) and adjust tier thresholds or reward structures accordingly.",
