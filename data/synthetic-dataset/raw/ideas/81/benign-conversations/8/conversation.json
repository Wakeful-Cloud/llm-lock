Seattle\u2019s index of **115** means the overall cost of living is about **15\u202f% higher** than in New York.\n\n### What does this mean for you?\nIf you were earning **$130,000** in New York, the Seattle cost\u2011of\u2011living would effectively reduce your purchasing power by roughly **$19,500**. To maintain the same standard of living, you\u2019d need a Seattle salary of about **$149,500**.\n\nGiven the median Seattle salary of **$152k**, a move would likely keep you at or slightly above the purchasing\u2011power equivalent of your current New York earnings, while also offering strong job growth.\n\nWould you like to see a personalized transition roadmap, recommended up\u2011skilling resources, or a draft resume tailored to Seattle senior backend roles?",
