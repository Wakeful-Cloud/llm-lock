Stars are formed from clouds of gas called nebulae. The Milky Way contains over 100 billion stars. Black holes have such strong gravity that not even light can escape. Supernovae occur when massive stars explode, scattering heavy elements into space. The nearest galaxy to the Milky Way is Andromeda, which is on a collision course with us in about 4 billion years. ...
