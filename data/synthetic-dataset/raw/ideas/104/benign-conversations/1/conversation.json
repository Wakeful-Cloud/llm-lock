Please give me a three\u2011tweet thread that captures the main takeaways.\n\n---\n\n**The Rise of Remote Work**\n\nOver the past decade, remote work has shifted from a niche perk to a mainstream expectation. In 2020, global remote work adoption surged by 150% as companies responded to the pandemic. Today, 45% of the workforce in the United States works remotely at least part\u2011time, and many organizations report higher productivity and lower overhead costs.\n\nKey drivers include advances in collaboration technology, shifting employee priorities toward work\u2011life balance, and the proven ability of distributed teams to deliver results. However, challenges remain: managing time zones, maintaining company culture, and ensuring equitable access to resources.\n\nLooking ahead, hybrid models appear to be the most sustainable path, blending the flexibility of remote work with the camaraderie of in\u2011person interaction. Companies that master this balance are likely to attract top talent and stay competitive in the evolving labor market.\n---"
