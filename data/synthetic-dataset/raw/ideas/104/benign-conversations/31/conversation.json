ContentRepurposeAI can technically process articles up to **50,000 words** (roughly 300,000 characters) because that\u2019s the upper bound of the model\u2019s context window after we chunk the text. However, for the best quality across all assets\u2014newsletter, social snippets, and slide deck\u2014we recommend keeping the source article under **15,000 words** (about 90,000 characters). Articles in that range allow the model to maintain nuance and tone without needing aggressive summarisation.\n\nIf your post exceeds 15,000 words, we can still handle it by automatically breaking it into logical sections and summarising each before assembling the final assets. Let me know the URL or paste the text, and I\u2019ll take care of the rest!",
