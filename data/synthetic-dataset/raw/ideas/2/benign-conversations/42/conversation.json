Your current on\u2011hand inventory is **120 units**, which is 15 units above the ROP.\n\n**Stock\u2011out risk for the next two weeks:** Low. With the forecasted average demand of 15\u202funits/day, the projected consumption over 14 days is 210\u202funits. Even after accounting for the lead\u2011time demand, the buffer (current inventory\u202f\u2013\u202fROP\u202f=\u202f15\u202funits) gives you roughly one day of safety.\n\n**Recommendation:** No immediate purchase order is required. I will continue to monitor the inventory and demand trends daily and alert you if the buffer falls below the safety stock threshold.\n\nWould you like me to set up a daily notification summary, or explore alternative suppliers as a precaution?",
