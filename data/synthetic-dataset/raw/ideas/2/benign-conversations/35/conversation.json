The top three alternative suppliers are:\n1. **SupplierB** \u2013 $5.10/unit, 4\u2011day lead time, reliability 95%, capacity 5,000 units.\n2. **SupplierC** \u2013 $4.95/unit, 6\u2011day lead time, reliability 90%, capacity 3,000 units.\n3. **SupplierD** \u2013 $5.20/unit, 3\u2011day lead time, reliability 88%, capacity 1,500 units.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Place a purchase order of **1,500 units** with SupplierA now to secure the limited capacity.\n- Simultaneously open a PO for **2,000 units** with SupplierB to cover the shortfall and mitigate the port\u2011strike risk.\n- I can generate and send those purchase orders, or adjust quantities based on your preferred safety stock. Let me know how you\u2019d like to proceed.",
