If service\u2011level targets are critical, the extra safety stock is justified. Otherwise, you may consider alternative mitigation such as faster logistics or a partial safety\u2011stock increase.\n\nWould you like me to generate a revised purchase\u2011order plan reflecting the 4\u2011week safety stock, or to notify the purchasing team of this recommendation?",
