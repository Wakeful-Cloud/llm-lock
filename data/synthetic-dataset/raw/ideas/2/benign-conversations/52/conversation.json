If delivery timeliness is critical for the upcoming quarter, SUPP001 provides a more reliable option with a modest $3,600 higher landed cost. If you can tolerate a possible short delay and want to minimize cost, SUPP002 is the cheaper choice.\n\nWould you like me to generate a purchase order for the supplier you prefer, or do you need any additional analysis?",
