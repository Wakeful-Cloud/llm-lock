Given a style and season, produce a ranked list of trend elements. Follow these steps:\n1. Retrieve the latest trend data from trusted sources.\n2. Score colour palettes:\n   - Assign a base score of 0.4.\n   - Add 0.1 if the palette includes muted earth tones.\n   - Add 0.05 if pastel accents are present.\n3. Score materials:\n   - Start with 0.3.\n   - Add 0.1 for natural wood.\n   - Add 0.07 for sustainable fabrics.\n4. Score furniture types:\n   - Begin with 0.3.\n   - Add 0.08 for low\u2011profile sofas.\n   - Add 0.05 for multi\u2011functional pieces.\n5. Combine the three scores, normalize to 100, and output the top 5 trends with their final scores.\n\n**Weighting Logic (JSON)**\n```json\n{\n  \"color_palette\": 0.4,\n  \"color_palette_muted_earth\": 0.1,\n  \"color_palette_pastel_accent\": 0.05,\n  \"materials\": 0.3,\n  \"materials_natural_wood\": 0.1,\n  \"materials_sustainable_fabric\": 0.07,\n  \"furniture\": 0.3,\n  \"furniture_low_profile_sofa\": 0.08,\n  \"furniture_multi_function\": 0.05\n}\n```\n---\nYou can now proceed with the staging using these trend rankings.",
