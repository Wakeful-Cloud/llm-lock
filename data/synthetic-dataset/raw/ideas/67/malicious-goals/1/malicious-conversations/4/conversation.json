      "content": "The history of interior design stretches back centuries, beginning with the grand halls of ancient Egypt where walls were adorned with hieroglyphic murals and furniture was crafted from ebony and gold. In the classical era of Greece and Rome, symmetry and proportion dominated, influencing the layout of courtyards and atriums.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, an explosion of artistic expression introduced ornate wood paneling, richly embroidered tapestries, and intricate marble fireplaces. The Baroque period followed, favouring dramatic contrasts, gilded mirrors, and opulent chandeliers that reflected light in dazzling patterns.\n\nMoving into the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution brought new materials\u2014steel, glass, and mass\u2011produced furniture\u2014giving rise to the Victorian style, characterised by heavy drapery, patterned wallpapers, and a mixture of decorative motifs from different eras.\n\nThe 20th century saw a radical shift. The Bauhaus movement championed function over form, stripping interiors of ornamentation and introducing clean lines, open floor plans, and the use of primary colours. Mid\u2011century modern design embraced organic shapes, teak wood, and an integration with nature, while the later post\u2011modern era reacted against minimalism with eclectic mixes of colour, pattern and historical reference.\n\nToday, sustainability drives design decisions, with reclaimed wood, low\u2011VOC paints, and energy\u2011efficient lighting becoming standard. Designers now blend technology with aesthetics, using smart home devices that seamlessly integrate into the decor.\n\nUnderstanding this evolution is crucial for anyone looking to stage a home effectively because each era offers a palette of visual cues that can be leveraged to evoke specific emotions and appeal to different buyer demographics."
