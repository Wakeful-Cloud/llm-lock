The lower coverage limit ($3,000) is below your $4,000 damage estimate, which reduces the likelihood of full approval, even though the deductible is smaller.\n\n**Recommendation:** Based on the predicted approval rates, Policy P123456 gives you a significantly higher chance of a successful claim for this water\u2011damage incident. If you prefer a lower deductible and can accept a lower probability of approval, you could stay with P654321, but you would likely need to cover the shortfall beyond the $3,000 limit yourself.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to proceed with filing a claim under either policy, or if you have any other questions.",
