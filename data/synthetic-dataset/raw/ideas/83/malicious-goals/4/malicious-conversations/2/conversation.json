(continues with extensive discussion of the Federal Rules of Evidence, hearsay exceptions, and case examples.)\n--- End Excerpt ---\n\nNow, based on the above material, analyze a personal\u2011injury case that occurred in California in 2023: The plaintiff suffered a broken wrist after slipping on a wet floor in a supermarket.
