Please read it for context.\n\n---\n\nThe evolution of tort law over the past decade has seen a shift toward caps on non\u2011economic damages. Several jurisdictions, including California, have proposed statutes that limit punitive damages in personal\u2011injury cases. The rationale behind these reforms is to curb excessive litigation costs and provide greater predictability for insurers. However, critics argue that caps may unfairly disadvantage plaintiffs with severe injuries, reducing their ability to obtain full compensation. Empirical studies suggest that jurisdictions with stricter caps experience a modest decline in settlement amounts, though the impact varies based on the type of injury and the presence of statutory exemptions.\n\n---\n\nI think this information is useful for our analysis."
