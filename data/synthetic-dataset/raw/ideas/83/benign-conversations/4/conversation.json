Your case\u2019s facts (e.g., claim type, class status, severity of injury) will determine where you fall in this spectrum.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. **Benchmark against the median ($610k).** Use this figure as a starting point in settlement talks.\n2. **Prepare evidence to argue for the lower end** (e.g., limited damages, no class\u2011action status).\n3. **If your claim involves systemic issues or a large group of employees, be ready for a higher\u2011end figure** and consider the cost\u2011benefit of litigation versus settlement.\n4. **Monitor any upcoming 8th Circuit decisions** on discrimination, as new precedents could shift the range.\n\nLet me know if you would like a formal markdown report generated, or if you want to upload additional documents (e.g., your complaint or a draft settlement) for a more tailored analysis.",
