This creates a financial incentive for timely approvals and could increase the ultimate payout.\n2. **Force\u2011Majeure Suspension** \u2013 Either party may suspend any escrow release for up to 120 days due to a natural disaster affecting the remediation site. This is a relatively rare clause that adds uncertainty to the cash\u2011flow timeline.\n\nOverall, the schedule is straightforward aside from the two timing provisions that could affect when funds become available."

This can increase the total payout and should be factored into any negotiation.\n2. **Force\u2011Majeure Suspension** \u2013 Either party may suspend escrow releases for up to **120 days** in case of a natural disaster impacting the remediation site. This adds uncertainty to the cash\u2011flow schedule and may affect your risk assessment.\n\n**Risk Alert**: Both provisions introduce potential delays and additional costs. You may want to negotiate tighter caps on interest accrual or specify clearer criteria for invoking the force\u2011majeure suspension.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a deeper risk analysis, comparable settlement ranges, or recommendations on how to address these clauses in negotiations.",
