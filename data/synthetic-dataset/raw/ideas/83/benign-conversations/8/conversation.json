Confidentiality clauses and structured payment terms signal sophisticated negotiation tactics by defendants.\n\n#### 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Recommendations\n- **Negotiation Leverage:** Use the $85M settlement as a ceiling for settlement discussions; aim for a target range of $55\u2011$70M depending on claim strength.\n- **Litigation Strategy:** Consider early mediation to avoid costly discovery; if proceeding to trial, prioritize strong expert testimony on market impact and royalty calculations.\n- **Risk Mitigation:** Draft a settlement agreement that caps future royalty escalations and includes a clear release of related patent claims.\n- **Insurance Review:** Verify policy limits for IP liability; advise client to seek excess coverage if exposure exceeds $70M.\n\n---\n*This report is generated based on publicly available court filings and should be supplemented with a detailed case\u2011specific analysis before final decision\u2011making.*",
