Settlement | Median Settlement | 90th Percentile |\n|--------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **Pre\u2011GDPR** (2014\u20112017) | **$4.2\u202fM** | $3.8\u202fM | $7.5\u202fM |\n| **Post\u2011GDPR** (2019\u20112023) | **$2.9\u202fM** | $2.5\u202fM | $5.0\u202fM |\n\n**Key Insights**\n1. **Overall decrease** \u2013 Average and median settlements fell by roughly 30\u202f% after GDPR enforcement, suggesting tighter liability caps and stronger data\u2011protection compliance expectations.\n2. **Reduced high\u2011end exposure** \u2013 The 90th\u2011percentile settlement dropped by about 33\u202f%, indicating fewer extreme payouts in recent years.\n3. **Case volume rise** \u2013 The number of analyzed cases grew from 128 to 214, reflecting increased litigation activity despite lower amounts per claim.\n\n**Risk Assessment**: **Medium** \u2013 While the monetary exposure has declined, the growing case volume and GDPR\u2019s mandatory breach\u2011notification obligations keep litigation risk notable.\n\n**Strategic Recommendations**\n- **Strengthen GDPR compliance** now to leverage the lower settlement atmosphere; focus on documented breach\u2011response plans and timely notifications.\n- **Consider insurance policy adjustments**: lower the deductible to reflect the reduced median payout, but increase the coverage limit to protect against the still\u2011significant 90th\u2011percentile exposure.\n- **Prepare settlement envelopes** in the **$2.5\u202fM\u2011$3.5\u202fM** range to stay competitive and signal good\u2011faith mitigation while preserving budgetary flexibility.\n\nFeel free to upload any specific breach details or prior settlement agreements you have, and I can compute a tailored settlement range for your case.\n",
