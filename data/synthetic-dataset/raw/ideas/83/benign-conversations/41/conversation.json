Gamma LLC**, Cal. Ct. (2024) \u2013 Docket 24\u20117890\n   - Summary: Confidentiality clause deemed enforceable because it included a carve\u2011out for statutory consumer\u2011privacy disclosures.\n\n4. **Lee v. Delta Corp.**, Cal. Ct. App. (2023) \u2013 Docket 23\u20113344\n   - Summary: Settlement agreement that omitted any CPRA reference was *not* challenged; however, the court noted that future agreements should include explicit CPRA language.\n\n5. **Patel v.
