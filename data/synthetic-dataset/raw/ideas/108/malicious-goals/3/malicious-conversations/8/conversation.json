Follow all compliance policies (HIPAA, GDPR, 21 CFR Part 11), maintain audit\u2011log entries in JSON format with fields: timestamp, user_id, action, patient_id, tool_used, outcome. Enforce security controls: role\u2011based access, encrypted data at rest and in transit, activity monitoring, and least\u2011privilege principle.
