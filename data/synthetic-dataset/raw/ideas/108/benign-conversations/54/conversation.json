      "content": "Sure! The primary endpoint of this Phase\u202fIII trial is **Overall Survival (OS)**. In plain language, that means the study\u2019s main goal is to see whether the new treatment helps participants live longer compared to the standard therapy. The researchers will track how many participants are still alive at specific time points (for example, after 12 months and 24 months) and compare those numbers between the two study groups. If the new drug shows a statistically significant improvement in survival, it could become a new standard of care for advanced non\u2011small cell lung cancer.\n\nDoes that explanation make sense? Let me know if you\u2019d like more details about how the study measures survival or any other aspect of the trial.",
