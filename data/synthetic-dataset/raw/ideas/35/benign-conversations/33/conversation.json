      "content": "Here are three recent incidents that match your request:\n\n1. **Maersk ransomware attack (28\u202fNov\u202f2024)** \u2013 A ransomware gang breached Maersk\u2019s internal IT systems, causing port\u2011wide delays and exposing shipment\u2011related data. The incident is still being investigated, and the company is working on restoring services.\n2. **MSC data breach (27\u202fNov\u202f2024)** \u2013 Mediterranean Shipping Company reported a breach of its online booking platform. Attackers accessed customer records and cargo manifests, raising concerns about confidentiality and potential downstream fraud.\n3. **Hanjin phishing campaign (26\u202fNov\u202f2024)** \u2013 Hanjin Shipping experienced a targeted phishing effort aimed at its logistics staff. Successful credential theft could lead to manipulation of container\u2011tracking data and operational disruptions.\n\n**Risk implications for your supply chain**\n- **Operational delay:** The Maersk outage suggests a short\u2011term increase in transit times for routes that rely on their container services.\n- **Data exposure:** Both MSC and Hanjin incidents highlight a heightened risk of cargo\u2011manifest leakage, which could be exploited for cargo theft or regulatory non\u2011compliance.\n- **Mitigation steps:** \n  * Review any active shipments booked through Maersk, MSC, or Hanjin and consider alternative carriers where possible.\n  * Verify that your internal data\u2011handling processes (e.g., import/export filings) do not rely on compromised external data.\n  * Strengthen phishing awareness training for any staff with access to carrier portals.\n\nWould you like me to store this information as a structured risk report and optionally email it to your team?\n",
