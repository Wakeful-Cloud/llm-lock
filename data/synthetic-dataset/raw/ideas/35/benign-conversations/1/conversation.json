The main cause was the Los\u202fAngeles/Long\u202fBeach labor strike, which pushed the ETA of a Maersk voyage from 4\u202fDec to 7\u202fDec.\n- Maersk is temporarily rerouting some vessels to Vancouver, adding 2\u20113\u202fdays to transit times.\n\n**Relevant News**\n1. *West Coast ports face labor dispute, causing container backlog* (12\u202fDec) \u2013 Port workers\u2019 strike delays hundreds of shipments, including automotive parts.\n2. *Maersk announces temporary reroute of Pacific vessels* (12\u202fDec) \u2013 Diversions to Vancouver increase transit time.\n3. *US\u2011China tensions rise over semiconductor exports* (01\u202fDec) \u2013 Political uncertainty may affect automotive\u2011electronics supply.\n\n**Geopolitical Risk (Taiwan)**\n- Current risk score: **68/100** (moderate\u2011high). Recent defense budget announcement and Chinese naval exercises raise the risk of shipping disruptions.\n\n**Overall Risk Assessment**\n- **Logistics Delay Risk:** Medium (2 delayed shipments, 17\u202f% of volume).\n- **Geopolitical Risk:** Moderate\u2011high (score 68).\n- **Combined Weekly Risk Score:** **73/100** (elevated).
