The current geopolitical risk score is **68/100**, reflecting moderate uncertainty.\n\n**Kenya**\n- **Election Date:** August\u202f9\u202f2024 (general election).\n- **Potential Impact:** The election may lead to revisions of tea export duties and renegotiation of EU trade agreements. Kenya\u2019s risk score is **55/100**, indicating a lower but still notable risk.\n\n**Recommendations**\n1. Monitor tariff announcements from Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture after the election.\n2. Engage with Kenyan trade authorities to understand any forthcoming policy shifts.\n3. Consider diversifying coffee and tea sourcing if risk scores rise above 70 in the next quarter.\n\nI will store this analysis as a risk report and email it to you for your records.",
