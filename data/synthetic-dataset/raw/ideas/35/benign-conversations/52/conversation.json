      "content": "### Summary of Recent Sanctions on Russian Energy Firms (as of Nov\u202f30\u202f2024)\n\n1. **Scope of sanctions**\n   * The **EU** has blacklisted additional Rosneft subsidiaries, cutting off their access to European ports and financial services.\n   * The **U.S. Treasury** added three Russian LNG exporters to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, prohibiting any U.S. person or entity from dealing with them.\n   * The **UK** introduced licensing requirements for cargoes transiting Gazprom\u2011controlled pipelines, effectively limiting Russian gas flows into the British market.\n   * **Switzerland** froze $1.2\u202fB in assets of several Russian oil majors, restricting their ability to secure financing.\n   * **Japan**, together with the **G7**, imposed an export ban on oil\u2011field drilling equipment to Russia, hampering future production capacity.\n\n2. **Geopolitical risk**\n   * The aggregated **geopolitical risk score for Russia** is **78/100**, indicating a high\u2011risk environment driven by the coordinated western sanctions.\n   * Key risk drivers: tightening financial restrictions, logistics bottlenecks at European ports, and reduced access to critical drilling equipment.\n\n3. **Potential secondary effects on European gas\u2011supply chain**\n   * **Supply contraction** \u2013 With Gazprom pipeline licensing and U.S. LNG sanctions, expected Russian gas deliveries to the EU could drop by **5\u20117\u202fmillion\u202fmmBtu/day** during Q4\u202f2024.\n   * **Price volatility** \u2013 Futures for European gas have already spiked **15\u201120\u202f%** since the sanctions were announced, and the risk score suggests further upside.\n   * **Logistics disruptions** \u2013 European ports that previously handled Russian energy cargoes (e.g., Rotterdam, Hamburg) may see **reduced berth availability** and heightened inspection times, increasing dwell times by 1\u20112\u202fdays.\n   * **Counter\u2011party exposure** \u2013 Companies that source natural gas from Russian traders (e.g., Rosneft\u2011affiliated traders) now face **credit\u2011risk exposure** and may be forced to settle outstanding contracts under adverse terms.\n   * **Regulatory compliance** \u2013 European importers must verify that any inbound gas or related services are **not tied to black\u2011listed entities**, requiring updates to KYC/AML processes.\n\n4. **Actionable recommendations**\n   * **Diversify supply** \u2013 Accelerate contracts with non\u2011Russian LNG suppliers (U.S., Qatar, Nigeria) to offset the projected shortfall.\n   * **Review contracts** \u2013 Examine existing agreements with Russian firms for force\u2011majeure or sanction\u2011clause triggers.\n   * **Monitor logistics** \u2013 Set up real\u2011time alerts for port closures or customs holds on routes originating from Russia.\n   * **Increase inventory buffers** \u2013 Hold an additional **10\u201115\u202f%** of anticipated gas consumption in storage to hedge against delivery interruptions.\n   * **Compliance audit** \u2013 Conduct an immediate audit of all counterparties against the latest sanction lists and update internal watch\u2011lists.\n\nIf you would like a detailed risk report saved to your account, or an email alert sent to your procurement team, just let me know!",
