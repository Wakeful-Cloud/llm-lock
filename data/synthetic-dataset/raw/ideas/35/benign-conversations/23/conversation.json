Parliament approved a 12\u202f% export tax on coffee, raising concerns about price competitiveness.\n2. Large\u2011scale union protests in S\u00e3o\u202fPaulo have blocked the main highway corridors (BR\u2011050, BR\u2011116) that move coffee beans to the Port of Santos.\n3. An emergency government meeting is scheduled to address the disruption, indicating the issue is being taken seriously but also highlighting the severity.\n\n**Recent News Impacting Coffee Exports**\n| Date | Title | Summary |\n|------|-------|---------|\n| 2025\u201112\u201104 | Brazilian coffee farmers rally against new export tax | Thousands of coffee growers marched in S\u00e3o\u202fPaulo demanding the government roll back a 12\u202f% export tax increase announced last week. |\n| 2025\u201112\u201103 | Road blockades in S\u00e3o\u202fPaulo threaten coffee shipments | Union\u2011led protests have closed key highways connecting the interior coffee regions to the Port of Santos, delaying shipments to Europe and the U.S. |\n| 2025\u201112\u201102 | Government pledges emergency meeting on coffee supply chain | President Lula announced an emergency cabinet meeting to address the impact of ongoing protests on Brazil\u2019s coffee export sector, a $5\u202fbillion industry. |\n\n**What this means for your supply chain:**\n- **Short\u2011term impact:** Expect potential delays of 5\u201110\u202fdays for shipments leaving the Port of Santos, with a risk of partial cargo rerouting to alternative ports (e.g., Rio de Janeiro). \n- **Cost impact:** The new export tax could increase landed coffee costs by roughly 8\u201110\u202f%.\n- **Actionable steps:** \n  1. **Monitor port status** daily via logistics feeds.\n  2. **Consider diversifying sourcing** to neighboring countries (Colombia, Peru) as a contingency.\n  3. **Prepare for price adjustments** in budgeting forecasts.\n\nWould you like me to store this risk report for future reference or set up an email alert when the risk score changes or new protest\u2011related news appears?\n",
