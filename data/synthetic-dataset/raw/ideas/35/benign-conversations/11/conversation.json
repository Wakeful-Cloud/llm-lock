      "content": "### South America Geopolitical Risk Overview (Last 6\u202fMonths)\n\n**Key Take\u2011aways**\n- **Brazil**: Risk score is **68/100**, up from the 55 level seen in June 2025 (driven largely by the recent export\u2011tariff policy and heightened security operations in the Amazon border). The tariff move has already caused a 3\u20114\u202f% dip in commodity export forecasts.\n- **Argentina**: Risk score is **74/100**, the highest in the region, reflecting intense post\u2011election unrest, a sharp peso decline, and ongoing IMF talks.\n- **Colombia, Chile, Peru**: While their scores sit in the 50\u201160 range, we observed sector\u2011specific issues \u2013 free\u2011trade agreements (Colombia), labor strikes in mining (Chile), and severe floods affecting logistics (Peru).\n\n**Notable Events (chronological)**\n| Date | Country | Event |\n|------|---------|-------|\n| 2025\u201107\u201103 | Peru | Heavy floods damage inland highways, delaying mineral shipments. |\n| 2025\u201108\u201118 | Chile | Copper\u2011mine labor strikes begin, risking global copper supply. |\n| 2025\u201109\u201112 | Colombia | New EU free\u2011trade pact signed, mitigating US\u2011China trade stress. |\n| 2025\u201110\u201105 | Argentina | Mass protests after contested election results; calls for audit. |\n| 2025\u201111\u201120 | Brazil | Government raises export tariffs on soy & corn, sparking trade\u2011partner concerns. |\n\n**Risk\u2011Score Trend (Brazil & Argentina)**\n```\nMonth   | Brazil | Argentina\n--------|--------|-----------\nJun\u201125 | 55     | 62\nJul\u201125 | 58     | 65\nAug\u201125 | 60     | 68\nSep\u201125 | 62     | 70\nOct\u201125 | 66     | 72\nNov\u201125 | 68     | 74\n```\nThe upward trajectory for both countries suggests growing geopolitical pressures that could affect supply\u2011chain stability, especially for commodities sourced from Brazil and manufacturing inputs from Argentina.\n\n**Recommendations**\n1. **Diversify suppliers** for soy\u2011based inputs away from Brazil or negotiate fixed\u2011price contracts to offset tariff risk.\n2. **Add buffer stock** for copper and lithium sourced from Chile, anticipating possible strike\u2011related delays.\n3. **Monitor Argentine political developments** weekly; consider alternative logistics routes (e.g., via Brazil\u2019s ports) if unrest escalates.\n4. **Set up automated alerts** for any news spikes related to the above events; I can push them to your email or webhook.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a formal PDF report stored in the system or an email summary sent to your team.\n",
