The reduction applies to parts that meet the new rules\u2011of\u2011origin criteria (minimum 35\u202f% regional value content).\n* **Timeline:** Full 2\u202f% rate is expected by Q4\u202f2027; provisional 4\u202f% rate in effect now.\n* **Supply\u2011chain impact:** Lower tariffs should lower landed\u2011costs for U.S. manufacturers importing parts from Mexico by roughly 4\u202f%\u20116\u202f% per unit, improving margin and potentially reshoring some production that had moved offshore.\n* **Geopolitical context:** \n  * United States risk score **22** \u2013 relatively low, reflecting political stability after recent elections and strong policy focus on supply\u2011chain resilience.\n  * Mexico risk score **35** \u2013 moderate; upcoming 2025 presidential election and recent labor\u2011policy protests could introduce short\u2011term uncertainties, but no immediate threats to tariff implementation.\n* **Key take\u2011aways:** The tariff reduction is a clear cost\u2011saving opportunity for automotive OEMs and tier\u20111 suppliers. Monitor Mexican labor\u2011policy developments and the 2025 election cycle for any potential delays in customs procedures or rule\u2011of\u2011origin certifications.\n\nI\u2019ve compiled this information into a report for your records.",
