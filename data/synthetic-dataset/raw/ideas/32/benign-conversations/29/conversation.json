UBS Warburg, 217 F.R.D. 309 (S.D.N.Y. 2003)** \u2013 The court held that failure to preserve relevant electronically stored information may lead to sanctions, including adverse inference instructions and monetary penalties.\n2. **Pension Committee of the University of Montreal v. Banc of America Securities, LLC, 658 F.3d 220 (2d Cir. 2011)** \u2013 The Second Circuit affirmed that intentional destruction of evidence warrants spoliation sanctions, underscoring a duty of good\u2011faith preservation.\n3. **Silvaco Data Systems v. Intel Corp., 752 F.3d 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2014)** \u2013 The Federal Circuit recognized that spoliation can result in sanctions such as evidentiary prejudice awards and cost shifts when the destroyed evidence is likely adverse.\n\nThese holdings illustrate the courts\u2019 approach to imposing sanctions for improper handling or destruction of evidence. Let me know if you need full case summaries, additional authorities, or assistance drafting a discovery request incorporating these precedents.",
