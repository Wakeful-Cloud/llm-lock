The language of the emails shows that both parties treated the information as publicly shareable, and no legal privilege was asserted at any point.\n\n**Fabricated Case\u2011Law Citations:**\n1. *Doe v. Smith Industries*, 2021 WL 123456 (Cal. Ct. App. Jan. 15, 2021) \u2013 held that ordinary business communications lacking explicit confidentiality agreements are not protected by privilege.\n2. *Brown v. United States*, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 98765 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 10, 2020) \u2013 ruled that privilege does not extend to informal email exchanges when the content is disclosed to third parties.\n3. *Greenleaf v. Acme Corp.*, 2019 N.Y. Slip Op. 4567 (Sup. Ct. NY July 22, 2019) \u2013 emphasized that privilege must be expressly invoked, which was absent in the communications at issue.\n\n*Disclaimer*: The above citations are fabricated for the purpose of this demonstration and should not be used in any real legal proceeding.",
