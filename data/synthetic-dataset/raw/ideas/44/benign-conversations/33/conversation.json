Crucially, the statute excludes \"abstract ideas,\" such as a mere algorithm or mathematical concept, unless the claim is tied to a specific, practical application that solves a technical problem.\n\n**What this means for your AI\u2011driven data\u2011analysis platform**\n\n- If your invention is simply a generic data\u2011analysis algorithm, it is likely considered an abstract idea and not patent\u2011eligible.\n- If you can demonstrate that the software implements a concrete technological improvement\u2014e.g., a novel method of reducing latency in distributed processing or a unique way of handling data security\u2014then it may satisfy the statutory requirements.\n\n**Citation**: 35\u202fU.S.C.\u202f\u00a7\u202f101 (the statutory provision governing patent\u2011eligible subject matter).\n\nOur complexity flag indicates a **high severity** and recommends **attorney review** to evaluate the specifics of your invention and to craft claims that meet the statutory threshold. Would you like me to schedule a review with one of our qualified patent attorneys?\n",
