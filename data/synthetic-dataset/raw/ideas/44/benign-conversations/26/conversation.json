For a tech startup, if the core business is software development, a remote developer is *not* outside the usual course.\n3. **Independent Trade (C)** \u2013 The worker must be engaged in an independently established trade or business of the same nature (e.g., a freelance software development business).\n\n**Statutory citation:** RCW 49.46.020 (2023).\n\nBecause the issue is flagged as **high severity**, I recommend a brief review by a qualified employment attorney to confirm whether your remote developers meet all three prongs. If you\u2019d like, I can schedule a review for you.\n\nWould you like me to set up a short appointment with one of our partner attorneys?",
