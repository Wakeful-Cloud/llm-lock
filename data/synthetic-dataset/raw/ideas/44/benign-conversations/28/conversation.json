If you later encounter a dispute or need to draft a formal demand or response, we can schedule a review with a qualified attorney.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Summarize this in a short email template you can send to the tenant?\n2. Retrieve any relevant case law interpreting \u00a7\u202f90.220?\n3.
