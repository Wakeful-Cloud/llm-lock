Code tit. 8, \u00a7\u202f275** and our internal *Delaware Corp Dissolution Checklist*, the process is straightforward:\n\n1. **Board Resolution** \u2013 Have the board adopt a resolution recommending dissolution.\n2. **Shareholder Approval** \u2013 Obtain a majority vote (or the threshold required by your certificate of incorporation) from the shareholders.\n3. **Tax Clearance** \u2013 File the final franchise\u2011tax report and secure a tax\u2011clearance certificate from the Delaware Division of Revenue.\n4. **Prepare Certificate of Dissolution** \u2013 Complete Delaware Form DSF, attach the board resolution and shareholder approval, and have an authorized officer sign it.\n5. **File with the Secretary of State** \u2013 Submit the certificate (online or by mail) together with the $204 filing fee. Once filed, the corporation ceases to exist as a Delaware entity.\n6. **Notify Creditors** \u2013 Publish a notice of dissolution in a newspaper of general circulation and send direct notice to any known creditors.\n7. **Settle Outstanding Claims** \u2013 Resolve any pending lawsuits, debts, or other obligations.\n8. **Distribute Remaining Assets** \u2013 After all liabilities are satisfied, distribute any remaining assets to shareholders in proportion to their ownership.\n9. **Retain Records** \u2013 Keep all dissolution documents, tax clearance, and resolutions for at least seven years.\n\n**Citation:** Del. Code tit.\u202f8, \u00a7\u202f275 (2023).\n\n**Complexity Flag:** *Low* \u2013 The steps are routine and do not appear to involve complex legal issues. However, if any of the following apply, you should schedule a review with an attorney:\n- There are minority shareholders who may contest the dissolution.\n- The corporation is involved in ongoing litigation or has significant liabilities.\n- You are uncertain about the tax\u2011clearance process.\n\nWould you like me to schedule a brief review with one of our Delaware corporate attorneys to confirm everything is in order, or do you feel comfortable proceeding on your own?\n",
