App. Ct. 2020)\n   *Holding:* The court held that a claim of undue influence requires proof of the testator\u2019s susceptibility, the influencer\u2019s opportunity, and a direct causal link between the influence and the testamentary act.\n   *Key Quote:* \"Undue influence is established when the testator was so susceptible to the influencer's conduct that the will reflects the influencer's wishes rather than the testator's own intentions.\"\n\n2. **In re Estate of Johnson**, 2019 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 9876 (Sup. Ct. 2019)\n   *Holding:* The court affirmed that oral statements of coercion, together with medical evidence of diminished capacity, satisfy the undue influence standard.\n   *Key Quote:* \"Undue influence may be inferred from a combination of the testator\u2019s infirmity and the beneficiary\u2019s exertion of pressure over the testator\u2019s estate planning decisions.\"\n\n3. **Estate of Green**, 2021 N.Y. Sup. Ct. LEXIS 4567 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2021)\n   *Holding:* The court clarified that the burden of proof rests on the challenger and that the existence of a confidential relationship alone is insufficient.\n   *Key Quote:* \"A confidential relationship is a requisite element, but it must be coupled with proof of actual coercion or manipulation for a claim of undue influence to succeed.\"\n"

      "content": "In New York, to contest a will on the ground of undue influence you must demonstrate three elements:\n1. **Susceptibility** \u2013 the testator was vulnerable (e.g., due to age, illness, or emotional dependence).\n2. **Opportunity/Confidential Relationship** \u2013 the alleged influencer had a position that allowed them to exert pressure.\n3. **Causal Link** \u2013 the influencer\u2019s conduct actually caused the testator to execute the will in a manner that reflects the influencer\u2019s wishes rather than the testator\u2019s own intent.\n\nThe cases above illustrate how New York courts apply these elements:\n- *Matter of Estate of Smith* emphasizes the need for a direct causal link.\n- *In re Estate of Johnson* shows that oral coercion combined with medical evidence of diminished capacity can satisfy the standard.\n- *Estate of Green* clarifies that a confidential relationship alone is not enough; concrete proof of coercion is required.\n\n**Practical Takeaway:** If you can provide evidence that your mother was particularly vulnerable, that the person pressuring her had a close, influential relationship with her, and that this pressure directly shaped the terms of the will, you have a viable claim for undue influence.\n\nIf you would like, I can schedule a brief review with a qualified probate attorney to assess the specifics of your situation and discuss next steps.\n",
