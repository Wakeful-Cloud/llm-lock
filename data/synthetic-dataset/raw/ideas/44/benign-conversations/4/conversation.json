The claim may rely on either an **express warranty** (UCC \u00a72\u2011313) or the **implied warranty of merchantability** (UCC \u00a72\u2011314). The core elements you must establish are:\n1. **Existence of a warranty** \u2013 either a specific promise made by the seller (express) or the statutory guarantee that the goods are merchantable (implied).\n2. **Breach of that warranty** \u2013 the goods delivered failed to meet the expressed promise or were not fit for their ordinary purpose.\n3. **Causation and damages** \u2013 the breach caused you monetary loss.\n4. **Timely notice** \u2013 you gave the seller reasonable notice of the breach as required by the UCC.\n\n**Citations:** UCC \u00a72\u2011313 (express warranty); UCC \u00a72\u2011314 (implied warranty of merchantability).\n\n**Next steps:** Because the system flagged this issue with a moderate complexity rating, we recommend a brief review by a qualified attorney to ensure the facts align with the statutory elements and to help quantify damages.
