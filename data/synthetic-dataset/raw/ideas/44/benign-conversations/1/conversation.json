      "content": "### Enforceability of Non\u2011Compete Clauses in Texas\n\nTexas generally enforces non\u2011compete agreements **when they are reasonable** in scope, duration, and geographic limitation and when they protect a legitimate business interest such as trade secrets or goodwill.\n\nKey points from recent Texas case law:\n\n- **Brown v. Carter**, 578 S.W.3d 123 (Tex. 2022) \u2013 Upheld a non\u2011compete that was limited to a **2\u2011year duration** and a **state\u2011wide geographic scope**, finding it reasonable given the employer\u2019s trade\u2011secret interests.\n- **Smith v. XYZ Corp.**, 645 S.W.3d 456 (Tex. 2021) \u2013 Struck down a clause that was **overly broad** (no time limit and nationwide restriction), emphasizing that enforceability hinges on reasonableness.\n\nOur firm\u2019s internal memo (2023) echoes this approach, recommending:\n- **Maximum duration:** 2 years.\n- **Geographic limitation:** Typically the state of Texas or a defined market area.\n- **Clear definition** of the protected business interest.\n\n### Practical Guidance\nIf you proceed, consider using the sample clause language from the memo, tailor the geographic scope to the specific market you operate in, and ensure the duration does not exceed two years unless you have a compelling justification.\n\n### Next Steps\nYour question was flagged **highly complex** because the enforceability analysis can vary based on the specifics of your business and the employee\u2019s role. **We recommend a brief review by a qualified employment\u2011law attorney** to confirm that the clause meets Texas standards and aligns with your company\u2019s needs.\n\nWould you like me to **schedule a review with one of our attorneys**? Please let me know a preferred date and time, or feel free to ask any follow\u2011up questions.",
