Below is a concise, citation\u2011ready summary of the filing steps you\u2019ll need to follow:\n\n1. **Identify Like\u2011Kind Property** \u2013 The property you are relinquishing and the replacement must be of the same nature or character (real estate is the most common, as personal property like equipment no longer qualifies after 2018).\n2. **Engage a Qualified Intermediary (QI)** \u2013 You cannot receive the cash proceeds directly; a QI must hold the funds and facilitate the exchange.\n3. **45\u2011Day Identification Window** \u2013 Within 45 calendar days of the sale of your original property, you must formally identify the replacement property(ies) in writing to the QI. You may identify up to three properties regardless of value, or more under the 200%/95% rules.\n4. **180\u2011Day Exchange Completion** \u2013 The replacement property must be received (or the title transferred) within 180 calendar days of the sale of the relinquished property, or by the tax return due date (including extensions), whichever is earlier.\n5. **Document the Transaction** \u2013 Provide the QI with the sale and purchase closing statements, and retain all exchange documentation.\n6. **Report on Your Tax Return** \u2013 File Form 8824, *Like\u2011Kind Exchanges*, with your federal tax return, attaching a copy of the QI\u2019s certification and the pertinent sections of \u00a71031.\n\n**Citation:** *Internal Revenue Code \u00a71031 (2023).* \n\nThe steps are straightforward, but because timing is critical, I\u2019ll run a quick complexity check to see if any part of this exchange might benefit from a brief attorney review.\n",
