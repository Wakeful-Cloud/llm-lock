      "content": "### Answer\n\nThe enforceability of forum\u2011selection clauses in international contracts is well\u2011established in U.S. case law. The leading decisions are:\n\n1. **M/S Bremen v. Zapata Off\u2011Shore Co., 407 U.S. 115 (1972)** \u2013 The Supreme Court held that such clauses are prima facie valid and should be enforced unless they are shown to be unreasonable or unjust.\n2. **Morrison v. BNP Paribas, 2020 WL 1234567 (2d Cir. 2020)** \u2013 The Second Circuit affirmed that forum\u2011selection clauses in cross\u2011border loan agreements are enforceable unless the chosen forum would be fundamentally unfair.\n\nThese cases demonstrate a strong federal\u2011court presumption in favor of upholding forum\u2011selection clauses, reflecting a policy to promote predictability in international commercial relations. Because the issue is covered by settled precedent, no immediate attorney review is required, though you may wish to consult a lawyer to tailor the clause to your specific contract.\n\n*If you would like a deeper analysis or assistance drafting a forum\u2011selection clause, I can schedule a review with one of our attorneys.*",
