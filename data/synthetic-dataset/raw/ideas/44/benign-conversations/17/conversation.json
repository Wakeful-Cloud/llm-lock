While the SAFE is a relatively simple instrument, the interaction of the cap, discount, and pro\u2011rata rights can have substantial impact on your future equity structure. It\u2019s advisable to have a qualified attorney review the specific terms before you sign.\n\nWould you like me to schedule a brief review with one of our venture\u2011capital attorneys? If so, please let me know a preferred date\u2011time (ISO\u20118601) and I\u2019ll arrange the meeting.\n",
