Proc. \u00a7 1161a** for the statutory requirement.  \n2. **Serve the Notice Properly**  \n   - Personal delivery, posting, or certified mail with return receipt.  \n   - Keep proof of service; this is crucial for the upcoming unlawful detainer action.  \n3. **Wait the Statutory Period**  \n   - The tenant has three days after service to pay the full amount due.  \n4. **File an Unlawful Detainer Action**  \n   - If payment is not made, file a complaint (Form UD\u2011100) in the appropriate Superior Court.  \n   - Attach the notice and proof of service as exhibits.  \n5. **Anticipate Defenses**  \n   - Review the tenant\u2019s lease for any clauses that might affect notice requirements.  \n   - Be ready to address claims of improper notice (see *Garcia v. Hernandez*), habitability, or rent credits.\n\n### Key Citations\n\n- **Statutes**: Cal. Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u202f1161a; Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7\u202f1946.1 (for general termination notice rules, not applicable to non\u2011payment but useful for context).  \n- **Cases**:\n  - *Johnson v. Smith*, 2022 WL 123456 \u2013 validates a properly drafted 3\u2011day notice.  \n  - *Garcia v. Hernandez*, 2021 WL 987654 \u2013 emphasizes need to attach lease copy.  \n  - *Lee v. Martinez*, 2020 WL 543210 \u2013 confirms proceeding to unlawful detainer after notice period.\n\n### Internal Guidance\n\nRefer to the firm\u2019s internal memo for the exact wording of the notice and a checklist for service and filing.  \n\n### Complexity Flag\n\nThe issue was flagged **high** in complexity due to potential defenses and the importance of strict compliance with notice requirements. I will schedule a review with one of our senior real\u2011estate attorneys.\n\nWould you like me to set up a convenient time for an attorney to review your case and finalize the notice?\n",
