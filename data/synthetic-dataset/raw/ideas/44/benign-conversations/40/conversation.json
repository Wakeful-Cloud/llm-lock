Remote work does **not** create an exemption from the minimum\u2011wage requirement.\n\n2. **Overtime (29 U.S.C. \u00a7216)** \u2013 Overtime must be paid for any hours exceeding 40 in a workweek, even if those hours are performed remotely. The employer must track remote work hours just as it does for on\u2011site work.\n\nPotential FLSA issues for your remote\u2011work policy:\n- **Time\u2011tracking compliance** \u2013 The policy must require employees to record all hours worked, including any work performed off\u2011site.\n- **Meal\u2011break and rest\u2011break rules** \u2013 If the policy allows flexible scheduling, ensure that required breaks (where applicable) are still provided.\n- **Exempt vs. non\u2011exempt classification** \u2013 Misclassifying remote employees as exempt can lead to liability if they work overtime.\n\nI\u2019ll now assess whether the complexity of this issue warrants a lawyer\u2019s review.\n",
