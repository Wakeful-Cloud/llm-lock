      "content": "### Risk Overview for Your Manufacturing Plant\n\n**Statutory Basis**\n- **33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1311** (Clean Water Act) makes any person who violates a permit, order, or condition liable to the United States for **up to $25,000 per day** for each day a prohibited pollutant is discharged, with higher amounts for *willful* violations. The statute also allows the EPA to seek injunctions, recovery of cleanup costs, and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties.\n\n**Key Case Law**\n- *United States v. Riverdale Corp.*, **US_2021_001** \u2013 Confirms the EPA\u2019s authority to assess the maximum daily civil penalty for each day a discharge continues.\n- *United States v. GreenTech Industries*, **US_2018_042** \u2013 Enforces the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle; the court upheld both cleanup cost recovery and civil fines.\n- *United States v. Oceanic Manufacturing*, **US_2015_017** \u2013 Highlights that willful violations can lead to **enhanced civil penalties and criminal prosecution**.\n\n**Potential Exposure for Your Plant**\n1. **Daily Civil Penalties** \u2013 If a discharge continues for 30 days, penalties could reach **$750,000** (30\u202f\u00d7\u202f$25,000). Willful conduct could raise this amount substantially.\n2. **Cleanup Costs** \u2013 Under the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d doctrine, your firm may be responsible for all remediation expenses, which can run into millions depending on the extent of contamination.\n3. **Injunctions & Operational Impact** \u2013 The EPA can seek an injunction halting operations until compliance is achieved, potentially causing production downtime.\n4. **Criminal Liability** \u2013 If the violation is deemed willful, the Department of Justice may pursue criminal charges, carrying fines up to $100,000 per violation and possible imprisonment for responsible individuals.\n\n**Complexity Flag**\n- The issue has been flagged as **high severity** due to the combination of substantial civil penalties, possible criminal exposure, and mandatory cleanup obligations.\n\n**Next Steps**\n- **Immediate Action:** Conduct an internal environmental audit to determine if any discharges have occurred without proper permits.\n- **Legal Review:** I recommend scheduling a review with one of our environmental law attorneys to assess the facts, evaluate permit compliance, and develop a remediation strategy.\n\nWould you like me to arrange a 30\u2011minute consultation with an attorney? If you have a preferred time, please let me know, and I\u2019ll set it up.\n",
