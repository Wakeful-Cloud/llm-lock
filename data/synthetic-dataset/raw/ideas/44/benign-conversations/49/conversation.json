      "content": "**Answer:**\nUnder Delaware law, a corporation may issue shares of a new class or series (such as Series A preferred stock) without a shareholder vote **if the board of directors authorizes the issuance** and the corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation permits it. This is stipulated in **Section 151(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law**, which states that the board can determine the number of shares, price, and other terms of issuance.\n\n**Key points to consider**\n1. **Board Authorization** \u2013 The board must adopt a resolution approving the Series A preferred stock issuance.\n2. **Certificate of Incorporation** \u2013 The corporation\u2019s certificate must already authorize a series of preferred stock. If it does not, an amendment (requiring shareholder approval) would be needed.\n3. **Rights & Preferences** \u2013 Preferred stock typically carries special rights (e.g., liquidation preferences, voting rights, conversion features). Drafting these terms correctly is essential to avoid future disputes.\n\nBecause your question touches on corporate governance and the drafting of preferred\u2011stock rights, **the system flags this issue as high\u2011severity and recommends attorney review**. A qualified corporate attorney can ensure that:\n- The board resolution complies with internal governance policies.\n- The preferred stock terms are consistent with Delaware law and your business goals.\n- Any necessary amendments to the certificate of incorporation are properly prepared.\n\nWould you like me to **schedule a review with one of our partner attorneys**? If so, please provide a preferred time (ISO\u20118601 format) and your client ID, and I\u2019ll arrange the appointment.\n\n*Citation:* Delaware General Corporation Law \u00a7\u202f151(b) (2023).",
