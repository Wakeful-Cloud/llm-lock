      "content": "Based on the cases above, a punitive\u2011damage\u2011limitation clause in a Texas commercial contract is generally enforceable **if**:\n\n1. **The clause is clear and unambiguous** \u2013 the language must expressly state the dollar cap and the type of damages it covers. (See *XYZ Corp. v. ABC Ltd.*)\n2. **The provision is conspicuous** \u2013 it should be in a bolded or separate section, or otherwise brought to the parties\u2019 attention. (See *Doe v. Sample Co.*, where the lack of conspicuousness led to unenforceability.)\n3. **The limitation does not violate public policy** \u2013 Texas courts will not enforce limitations that would effectively deprive a party of a remedy for egregious conduct. (The *XYZ Corp.* decision confirms enforceability when the limit is reasonable and consistent with public policy.)\n4. **The parties negotiate or expressly agree** \u2013 evidence of negotiation or a signed acknowledgment strengthens enforceability (see *Acme Inc. v. Beta LLC*).\n\nApplying these principles to your $50,000 cap:\n- Draft the clause in plain language, e.g., \u201cThe parties agree that punitive damages arising from any claim under this agreement shall be limited to a maximum of $50,000.\u201d\n- Place the clause in a highlighted section (e.g., bold heading \u201cLimitation of Damages\u201d).\n- Obtain the client\u2019s signed acknowledgment that they have read and understood this limitation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The clause should be enforceable in Texas if you follow the guidelines above. No immediate attorney review is required, but you may want a qualified Texas attorney to give a final sign\u2011off before the contract is executed.\n\n**Citations:**\n- XYZ Corp. v. ABC Ltd., No. 20\u20111234, 2020 WL 123456 (Tex. App. \u2013 Dallas Apr. 15, 2020).\n- Doe v. Sample Co., No. 15\u20115678, 2015 WL 789012 (Tex. App. \u2013 Houston Sep. 22, 2015).\n- Acme Inc. v.
