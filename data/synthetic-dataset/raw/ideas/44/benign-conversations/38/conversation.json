The surrogate may be designated as a medical power of attorney.\n\n(2) The advance directive must be in writing, signed by the declarant, and either witnessed by two competent adults who are not the designated surrogate, or acknowledged before a notary public. If the declarant is a minor, the directive must be executed by a parent or legal guardian and must be subject to the same witnessing or notary requirements.\n\n(3) The designated surrogate must act in the best interest of the declarant and may only make decisions that are consistent with the declarant\u2019s expressed wishes, as set forth in the advance directive.\"\n\n[Source: Florida Statutes \u00a7 744.321 (2023)]"

      "content": "### How to Grant a Medical Power of Attorney for Your Child in Florida\n\n1. **Prepare the Advance Directive Form**\n   - Use a Florida\u2011approved medical power of attorney (or advance directive) form. The form must state that you, as a parent, are appointing a health\u2011care surrogate for your child.\n\n2. **Signature Requirements**\n   - **If you, the parent, sign the form:**\n     - Sign in the presence of **two competent adult witnesses** who are **not the appointed surrogate** (or the child, if old enough).\n     - Alternatively, you may sign before a **notary public**.\n   - **If the child is a minor (under 18):**\n     - The parent/guardian\u2019s signature satisfies the statutory requirement; the same witnessing/notary rules apply to the parent\u2019s signature.\n\n3. **Provide Copies**\n   - Give a copy of the signed form to your child's primary health\u2011care provider, any hospital or clinic you anticipate using, and keep a copy in a safe but accessible place.\n\n4. **Record Keeping**\n   - Although Florida does not require filing the form with a government agency, you may choose to keep it with other important documents (e.g., birth certificate, insurance policies).\n\n5. **Revocation (if needed)**\n   - You can revoke the medical POA at any time by delivering a written revocation to the same parties that received the original form.\n\n#### Citation\nFlorida Statutes \u00a7\u202f744.321 (2023) \u2013 Advance Directives for Health Care.\n\n**Complexity Flag:** Low \u2013 This is a standard statutory process; no immediate attorney involvement is required. However, if you have any special circumstances (e.g., existing custody agreements, contested decisions) or want personalized advice, I can schedule a brief review with a qualified attorney.\n\nWould you like me to arrange a short appointment with one of our family\u2011law attorneys to double\u2011check the form or answer any follow\u2011up questions?",
