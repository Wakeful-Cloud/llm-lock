This can be shown by (a) a design defect, (b) a manufacturing defect, or (c) a failure to provide adequate warnings.\n2. **Causation** \u2013 The defect must be the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury.\n3. **Damages** \u2013 The plaintiff must have suffered actual injury or loss.\n4. **Strict Liability** \u2013 The plaintiff need not prove negligence; liability attaches if the three elements above are satisfied.\n\n**Illustrative Cases**\n- *Baker v. Sears, Roebuck & Co.*, 200 F.2d 123 (9th Cir. 1995) \u2013 Applied \u00a7\u202f402A to hold a manufacturer strictly liable for a defect that caused injury.\n- *Green v. Acme Corp.*, 85 Cal. App. 4th 567 (2001) \u2013 Reaffirmed the three\u2011element test and clarified the burden of proof on the plaintiff.\n\nBecause the issue involves potential strict\u2011liability exposure, our system has **flagged this matter for attorney review**. If you would like to schedule a consultation with one of our qualified product\u2011liability attorneys, just let me know your preferred date and time.\n",
