      "content": "Here\u2019s a concise answer to your question:\n\n**Tax implications of ISOs vs. NSOs**\n1. **Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)** \u2013 No ordinary income is recognized at grant or exercise if the ISO holding period (2\u202fyears from grant, 1\u202fyear from exercise) is satisfied. The spread at exercise is a preference item for the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) under IRC\u202f\u00a7\u202f56. If you sell the shares after meeting the holding period, any gain is taxed as long\u2011term capital gain.\n2. **Non\u2011Qualified Stock Options (NSOs)** \u2013 The spread between fair market value at exercise and the strike price is ordinary taxable income to the employee and is subject to payroll withholding (Form\u202fW\u20112). The employer gets a compensation deduction equal to that amount. No AMT considerations apply.\n3. **Reporting** \u2013 Both ISO and NSO exercises must be reported on the employee\u2019s Form\u202fW\u20112 (or Form\u202f1099\u2011MISC for non\u2011employees). ISO exercises that create AMT preference must be reported on Form 6251.\n4. **Employer obligations** \u2013 Employer must withhold income and payroll taxes for NSOs and for ISO exercises that generate AMT preference. The employer also must issue a Form\u202f1099\u2011NEC for non\u2011employee recipients of NSOs.\n5. **Key citations** \u2013 IRC\u202f\u00a7\u202f83 (taxation of property transferred for services) and IRC\u202f\u00a7\u202f421 (treatment of ISOs). See the full text of IRC\u202f\u00a7\u202f83 above.\n\nBecause the issue is flagged as **high\u2011complexity**, I recommend a brief review with one of our tax attorneys to ensure compliance with AMT rules, filing deadlines, and any state\u2011specific requirements.\n\nWould you like me to schedule a 30\u2011minute review with an attorney? Please provide your preferred date and time, or I can suggest the next available slot.",
