(See *Browne v. Superior Court*, 55 Cal.4th 1052; *Liu v. Denny*, 179 Cal.App.4th 1235.)\n- **Requirements**: Prove the misrepresentation was material, the buyer relied on it, and damages resulted from the reliance.\n- **Next steps**: Gather all communications and documents showing the seller\u2019s statements about zoning, and any due\u2011diligence reports. Bring these to your meeting with Attorney Gomez.\n\nIf you have any other questions before the meeting, feel free to ask!",
