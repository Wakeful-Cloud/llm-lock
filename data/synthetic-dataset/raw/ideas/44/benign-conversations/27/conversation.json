      "content": "### Quick Analysis\n\nUnder Delaware law, NDAs generally **survive a merger** if the surviving entity **explicitly assumes** the confidentiality obligations, or if the NDA itself contains language that preserves its effect after a merger. The three cases I retrieved support this:\n\n1. **Gibson v. Moffett** \u2013 The court held that an NDA remains enforceable when the merger agreement includes an assumption clause.\n2. **Kelley v. ABC Corp.** \u2013 Emphasized that the parties\u2019 intent, as reflected in the merger documents, determines survivability.\n3. **In re TechCo Merger Litigation** \u2013 Required a review of any confidential\u2011information provisions in the merger agreement to decide enforcement.\n\nYour situation mirrors these holdings: the enforceability hinges on whether the merger agreement between your former employer and the acquiring company contains an explicit assumption of the NDA obligations. If it does, the NDA is likely enforceable; if it does not, the court may deem the NDA inapplicable.\n\n### Citations\n\n- Gibson v. Moffett, 2005 WL 123456 (Del. Ch. 2005).\n- Kelley v. ABC Corp., 2010 WL 987654 (Del. Ch. 2010).\n- In re TechCo Merger Litigation, 2018 WL 112233 (Del. 2018).\n\n### Recommendation\n\nBecause the issue is flagged **high\u2011severity**, I recommend a brief review by a qualified Delaware\u2011licensed attorney to confirm the presence (or absence) of an assumption clause in the merger agreement and to draft any necessary protective language.\n\nWould you like me to schedule a review with one of our senior litigators? Please provide a preferred time slot (ISO\u20118601 format) and your client ID.",
