      "content": "### Enforceability of Arbitration Clauses in Securities Agreements\n\nThe governing statute is the **Federal Arbitration Act** (FAA), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u202f1\u201116. Under the FAA, arbitration agreements are **prima facie enforceable** and are not subject to any special level of scrutiny; a court must generally stay litigation and compel arbitration when a valid agreement exists.\n\n#### Leading Authority\n- **Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon**, 482 U.S. 220 (1987) \u2013 the Supreme Court held that arbitration clauses in securities brokerage contracts are enforceable under the FAA. {case_001}\n- **Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler\u2011Plymouth, Inc.**, 473 U.S. 614 (1985) \u2013 the Court confirmed the FAA\u2019s broad application to commercial contracts, including those involving securities. {case_002}\n\n#### Practical Takeaway\nGiven the FAA\u2019s strong federal policy favoring arbitration and the Supreme Court\u2019s clear rulings, an arbitration clause in a securities agreement is **likely enforceable**, provided it meets ordinary contract\u2011formation requirements (offer, acceptance, consideration, and clear intent to arbitrate).\n\n#### Complexity Flag\nThe issue has been flagged as **low complexity**, meaning no immediate attorney review is required. However, you may wish to have your counsel verify the specific language of the clause to ensure it meets the standard legal criteria.\n\n*If you later decide that a human attorney should review the clause or schedule a consultation, just let me know and I can set that up for you.*",
