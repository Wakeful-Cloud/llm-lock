Introduction & Controller Identity** (Art.\u202f13(a))\n- State the name of your business, contact details, and the data\u2011protection officer (if applicable).\n\n**2. Purpose & Lawful Basis** (Art.\u202f13(b)\u2011(c))\n- Explain why you collect personal data (e.g., order fulfillment, marketing) and cite the specific lawful basis (e.g., contract performance, legitimate interests).\n\n**3. Data Categories & Sources** (Art.\u202f13(d) & Art.\u202f14)\n- List the categories of data you process (name, email, payment info, IP address). If data come from third\u2011party sources, note that you will inform users within one month (Art.\u202f14).\n\n**4. Recipients & International Transfers** (Art.\u202f13(e))\n- Identify any third parties (payment processors, shipping carriers) and describe safeguards for transfers outside the EEA (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses).\n\n**5. Retention Period** (Art.\u202f13(f))\n- Provide a clear retention schedule (e.g., order data retained for 7\u202fyears for tax purposes, marketing lists deleted after 24\u202fmonths of inactivity).\n\n**6. Data Subject Rights** (Art.\u202f12 & Art.\u202f15)\n- Summarize the rights to access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, and objection. Explain how users can exercise these rights (e.g., email address).\n\n**7. Automated Decision\u2011Making** (Art.\u202f13(g))\n- State whether any automated profiling occurs; if not, explicitly mention that none is used.\n\n**8. Security Measures** (Art.\u202f32)\n- Outline technical safeguards such as SSL/TLS encryption, password hashing, regular security audits, and staff training.\n\n**9. Complaints**\n- Provide the contact information for the relevant supervisory authority (e.g., Data Protection Commission of the EU member state).\n\n**Citations**\n- GDPR Art.\u202f12, 13, 14, 15, 32 \u2013 Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n\n**Next Steps**\nI\u2019ve flagged this request as **moderate complexity** because tailoring retention periods and lawful\u2011basis assessments often require a qualified attorney to ensure full compliance with sector\u2011specific rules.\nWould you like me to schedule a short review with one of our partner lawyers?",
