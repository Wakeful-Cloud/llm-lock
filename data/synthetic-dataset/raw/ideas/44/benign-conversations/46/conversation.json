The landlord must serve a written notice to quit the premises. The notice shall be in writing, state the specific ground for termination, and be signed by the landlord or the landlord\u2019s authorized agent. The notice must be served either (1) personally to the tenant, (2) by leaving a true copy at the tenant\u2019s usual place of residence and mailing a copy to the tenant\u2019s last known address, or (3) by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the tenant\u2019s last known address. The notice period shall be at least 30 days for a month\u2011to\u2011month tenancy, unless a shorter period is provided by the lease agreement or other statutory provision. Failure to comply with these notice requirements renders any subsequent eviction proceeding procedurally defective.\""
