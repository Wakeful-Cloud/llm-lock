Section\u202f702 of the New York Business Corporation Law states that directors are shielded from personal liability for corporate obligations **unless** they have personally committed fraud, illegal conduct, or a breach of fiduciary duty that directly caused the debt, or the situation falls under the limited exceptions listed in \u00a7\u00a7\u202f710,\u202f1001, and\u202f203.\n\n**Bottom line:** For a typical LLC in New York, you, as a director, would not be personally liable for the company\u2019s unpaid debts, provided you have not engaged in wrongdoing that gave rise to those debts.\n\n*Citation:* N.Y. Bus. Corp. Law \u00a7\u00a7\u202f702,\u202f710,\u202f1001,\u202f203.\n\nBecause the issue is straightforward and falls under a clear statutory rule, no immediate attorney review is required. If you suspect any wrongdoing or have a more complex factual scenario, you may want to consult a lawyer for a deeper analysis.",
