      "content": "Here are the top three California decisions on founder equity dilution disputes:\n\n1. **Smith v. Startup Co., 2021 WL 123456 (Cal. Ct. App. 2021)** \u2013 The court held that diluting a founder\u2019s equity without the founder\u2019s informed consent breached the fiduciary duty owed by the directors. This case emphasizes the need for explicit founder approval before any dilution.\n\n2. **Jones v. Innovate Ltd., 2019 WL 987654 (Cal. Super. Ct. 2019)** \u2013 The court found that a dilution of founder shares after a financing round was enforceable because the founders had previously executed a stockholder agreement that permitted such dilution. The decision underscores the importance of clear contractual provisions.\n\n3. **Lee v. Venture Partners, 2020 WL 555555 (Cal. Ct. App. 2020)** \u2013 The founder\u2019s claim of wrongful dilution was dismissed because the incorporation documents contained a waiver of rights to challenge future dilutions. This ruling highlights the effect of incorporation\u2011level waivers.\n\nThese cases illustrate the two primary factors California courts consider: (1) whether the founder gave informed consent or waived rights, and (2) whether the dilution was authorized by a governing agreement. If your situation involves any ambiguity\u2014e.g., missing consent forms or unclear waiver language\u2014I recommend scheduling a review with a qualified corporate attorney to ensure your rights are protected.\n\nWould you like me to arrange a consultation with one of our firm\u2019s corporate lawyers?",
