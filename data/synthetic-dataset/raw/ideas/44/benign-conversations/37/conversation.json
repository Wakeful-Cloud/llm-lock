      "content": "### Summary of Findings\n\nIn New\u00a0York, courts will grant **preliminary injunctive relief** to enforce a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) when the plaintiff can show:\n1. A likelihood of success on the merits (i.e., a clear breach exists);\n2. Irreparable harm absent an injunction (e.g., loss of trade\u2011secret value);\n3. A balance of equities in the plaintiff\u2019s favor; and\n4. The public interest is not harmed.\n\nThe most directly on\u2011point authorities are:\n- **Doe v. Acme Corp., 123 N.Y.3d 456 (2020)** \u2013 *injunctive relief granted*\u3010NY2020-001\u3011\n- **Smith v. XYZ LLC, 110 N.Y.2d 789 (2018)** \u2013 *injunction issued*\u3010NY2018-045\u3011\n- **Jones v. TechCo, 98 N.Y. Misc. 321 (2015)** \u2013 *injunction denied* (useful to understand the need for evidence of likely success).\n\nBecause your situation involves potential trade\u2011secret loss and a request for immediate relief, the **complexity flag is HIGH**. This means a qualified attorney should review the specifics (e.g., the exact NDA language, the nature of the disclosed designs, and any communications with the competitor) before any legal motion is filed.\n\nWould you like me to **schedule a review with one of our attorneys**? If you have a preferred time, let me know; otherwise I can propose the next available slots.\n",
