Del. 2023) \u2013 The court read the profit\u2011sharing clause against the backdrop of fiduciary duties and required equal profit distribution.\n2. **Jones v. Acme JV**, 2022 WL 987654 (9th Cir. 2022) \u2013 A disproportionate allocation was found to breach the implied covenant of good faith; the case was remanded for a proper split.\n3. **Garcia v. BuilderCorp**, No. 21\u2011CV\u20110456 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) \u2013 The claim was dismissed because the parties had expressly agreed to a 60/40 profit split.\n4. **United States v. MegaJV**, No. 19\u2011258 (U.S. Sup. Ct. 2020) \u2013 The Supreme Court denied certiorari, leaving in place a lower\u2011court ruling that upheld the agreed profit\u2011sharing arrangement.\n5. **Lee v. Partners LLC**, 2019 WL 543210 (C.D. Cal. 2019) \u2013 The decision underscores the importance of clear profit\u2011sharing language to avoid litigation.\n\nThese cases illustrate that courts examine the language of the joint\u2011venture agreement, the parties\u2019 fiduciary duties, and the implied covenant of good faith when resolving profit\u2011sharing disputes. If your situation involves ambiguous terms or a perceived unfair split, you may want to review the specific provisions of your agreement and consider consulting an attorney for tailored advice.\n\n*Note: While these precedents are informative, they do not constitute legal advice. Let me know if you\u2019d like to schedule a review with an attorney.*",
