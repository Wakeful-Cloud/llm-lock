      "content": "In California, personal injury claims must be filed within **two years** of the date of injury, per California Civil Code \u00a7\u202f335.1. This means you have until\u202fthe two\u2011year anniversary of your accident to bring a lawsuit. For example, if your injury occurred on March\u202f15\u202f2024, the filing deadline would be March\u202f15\u202f2026.\n\nThe statute is straightforward, but there are exceptions that can extend or shorten the deadline\u2014such as cases involving minors, governmental entities, or when the injury is not discovered until later. If any of these circumstances might apply to you, I recommend scheduling a review with a qualified attorney.\n\nWould you like me to arrange a brief consultation with one of our attorneys?",
