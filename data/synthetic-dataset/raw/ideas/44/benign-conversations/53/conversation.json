They must be at least 18 years old, not currently married, and appear in person. (NRS \u00a7125.010)\n2. **Minor Applicants** \u2013 Persons under 18 can marry only with written consent from a parent or guardian **and** a court order authorizing the marriage. (NRS \u00a7125.020)\n3. **Prohibited Relationships** \u2013 Marriages between close relatives (e.g., parent\u2011child, siblings) or between a person and a former spouse whose divorce is not final are invalid. (NRS \u00a7125.030)\n4. **Consent** \u2013 Both individuals must give free and informed consent. Any fraud, duress, or mental incapacity voids the marriage. (NRS \u00a7125.040)\n5. **Officiant** \u2013 The ceremony must be performed by a licensed officiant (clergy, judge, or other authorized person). (NRS \u00a7125.050)\n6. **Record\u2011keeping** \u2013 After the ceremony, the officiant files the marriage certificate with the clerk as required by law. (NRS \u00a7\u00a7125.060\u2011125.080)\n\nIn plain English, to get married in Nevada you need a license, you must be an adult (or have parental and court approval if you\u2019re a minor), you can\u2019t be too closely related to your partner, you must both agree voluntarily, and a qualified officiant must solemnize the marriage. All of this is recorded with the county clerk.\n\n*Statutory source: Nevada Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7125.010\u2011125.080.*",
