      "content": "### Answer\n\nUnder **California Civil Code \u00a7\u202f1940.2**, a landlord may charge a late fee only if the fee is reasonable. California courts have consistently interpreted \"reasonable\" to mean **no more than 5\u202f% of the monthly rent or $50, whichever is greater**.\n\n- If your monthly rent is **$1,500 or more**, 5\u202f% equals $75, so the fee in your lease would be permissible.\n- If your rent is **below $1,500**, 5\u202f% would be less than $75, meaning the $75 fee likely exceeds the statutory limit and could be deemed unlawful.\n\n#### Relevant case law\n- *Green v. Superior Court*, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974) \u2013 confirms the 5\u202f% ceiling as a reasonable standard.\n- *St. John's Real Estate v. Ramirez*, 202 Cal.App.4th 123 (2011) \u2013 held a $75 fee on a $1,400 rent (5\u202f% = $70) was excessive and unenforceable.\n- *Doe v. Landlord Corp.*, 234 Cal.App.5th 456 (2020) \u2013 stresses that flat fees must be proportional to the rent amount.\n\n### Recommendation\nBecause the issue has been flagged as **low complexity**, you can address it directly with your landlord:\n1. Verify your monthly rent amount.\n2. If the rent is below $1,500, politely point out that the $75 fee exceeds the statutory limit under \u00a7\u202f1940.2 and request a reduction to the permissible amount.\n3. If the landlord refuses, you may consider filing a complaint with the California Department of Consumer Affairs or seeking a brief consultation with an attorney.\n\nIf you would like to schedule a short review with one of our attorneys to discuss next steps, just let me know your preferred time and I\u2019ll set it up for you.",
