Ct. App. 2019) \u2013 Enforceable because it was not punitive and reflected actual project costs.\n3. **United States v. Metro Builders**, 2020 WL 345678 (Fed. Civ. R. 2020) \u2013 Federal court affirmed enforceability where the parties\u2019 estimate was bona\u2011fide and not excessive.\n\nThese decisions illustrate that California courts (and the federal court in the third case) will enforce liquidated damages provisions when they are a genuine attempt to estimate losses, are not punitive, and are proportional to the anticipated harm. If you need deeper analysis or a review of how these rulings apply to your specific contract, let me know and I can flag the issue for attorney supervision or schedule a review.\n",
