The statute bars discharge of debts arising from a written contract that was entered into fraudulently. If your note was a bona\u2011fide loan without any fraudulent intent, it can be discharged.\n\n**Citation:** 11\u202fU.S.C.\u202f\u00a7523(a)(2).\n\n**Complexity Flag:** The system flagged this issue as **moderate** because it may involve a fraud analysis. If you are uncertain about the circumstances of the note, I recommend scheduling a brief review with one of our attorneys.\n\nWould you like me to arrange an attorney review?",
