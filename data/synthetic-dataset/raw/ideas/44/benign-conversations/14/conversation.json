The directors shall manage the business and affairs of the corporation, and shall exercise their powers in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, and in a manner they reasonably believe to be in the best interests of the corporation. The duties of loyalty and disclosure also apply, requiring directors to avoid personal conflicts of interest and to disclose material facts to the corporation.\"\n"

      "content": "Under Delaware law, directors owe two core fiduciary duties:\n\n1. **Duty of Care** \u2013 Directors must act with the diligence, competence, and prudence that a reasonably prudent person would use in similar circumstances. This includes making informed decisions after reasonable investigation.\n2. **Duty of Loyalty** \u2013 Directors must place the corporation\u2019s interests above their own, avoid self\u2011dealing, and disclose any material personal interests that could affect their judgment.\n\nThese duties are codified in **Delaware General Corporation Law \u00a7141(a)**, which states that directors must manage the corporation\u2019s affairs in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person would exercise, and in the best interests of the corporation.\n\nBecause the question concerns well\u2011settled statutory duties and does not involve complex fact patterns or novel legal issues, the issue is flagged as low\u2011complexity. No immediate attorney review is required, but you may wish to consult a corporate attorney for detailed advice on specific transactions.\n",
