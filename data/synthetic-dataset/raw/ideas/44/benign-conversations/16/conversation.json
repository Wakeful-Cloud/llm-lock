DataGuard LLC**, 2021 Cal. Super. Ct. 9876 \u2013 The court struck down a blanket limitation of liability for any data\u2011breach loss, finding it contrary to public policy when the provider\u2019s negligence was gross.\n3. **Miller v. TechServe, LLC**, 2023 Cal. App. 4th 15432 \u2013 The appellate court held that limitation clauses are enforceable if they do not waive liability for statutory violations under Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1798.150\u2011.155 (privacy breach).\n4. **SecureIT v. BetaSoft**, 2020 Cal.

The case law shows that California courts will generally enforce limitation\u2011of\u2011liability clauses for data\u2011breach damages **if** the clause:\n\n1. Is clear, conspicuous, and negotiated;\n2. Limits damages to a reasonable amount (often the fees paid in the prior 12 months or the contract price);\n3. Does not waive liability for statutory violations (e.g., California Consumer Privacy Act breaches);\n4. Excludes gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\nThe most directly on\u2011point authority is *Doe v. CloudSoft, Inc.* (2022) which upheld a limitation to the prior\u2011year fees, provided the provider maintained reasonable security measures.\n\nBecause the issue involves potential liability for statutory privacy breaches and the enforceability can hinge on the specific language, I will flag this for attorney review and arrange a meeting with a qualified data\u2011privacy lawyer.\n\nWould you like me to schedule a review now?
