Using GPL\u2011licensed code without complying with its terms can constitute infringement.\n\n**Key Case Law**\n- *Jacobsen v. Katzer* (2008 WL 2151055) \u2013 GPL terms are enforceable; violation can lead to infringement liability.\n- *Bazaar v. OpenSource Corp.* (2022 Cal. Ct. App. 453) \u2013 Failure to provide source code under GPL v2 breaches contract and copyright.\n- *Free Software Foundation v. TechCo* (2021 Cal. Super. Ct. 102) \u2013 Distribution of binaries requires accompanying source under GPL.\n\n**Firm\u2019s Internal Precedent**\n- Our 2024 memo outlines that MIT\u2011licensed code is permissive and requires only attribution, whereas GPL (v2/v3) imposes copyleft obligations, including source\u2011code disclosure for the entire work. For SaaS, the Affero GPL (AGPL) specifically closes the \u201cASP loophole,\" but standard GPL still raises compliance challenges if the code is incorporated into a proprietary service.\n\n**Risk Assessment**\n- **High severity** \u2013 Using GPL\u2011licensed libraries in a commercial SaaS product triggers copyleft obligations that could force you to release your proprietary source code, exposing trade secrets and affecting your business model.\n- **Mitigation Options**\n  1. **Replace** GPL components with permissively\u2011licensed alternatives (MIT, Apache\u202f2.0, BSD).\n  2. **Obtain a commercial license** from the copyright holder, if available.\n  3. **Segregate** GPL code into a separate service that can be open\u2011sourced without compromising core IP.\n  4. **Adopt AGPL** only if you intend to open\u2011source the entire SaaS offering.\n\nBecause the complexity flag returned **high**, I recommend a brief review with a qualified attorney to confirm the best compliance pathway for your product.\n\n---\n\nI have scheduled a 30\u2011minute attorney review for you. You will receive a calendar invitation shortly.\n\n**Appointment Details**\n- **Client ID**: client_9876\n- **Issue**: Use of GPL\u2011licensed code in a commercial SaaS product\n- **Preferred Time**: 2025-12-15T10:00:00Z (you may suggest an alternative if needed)",
