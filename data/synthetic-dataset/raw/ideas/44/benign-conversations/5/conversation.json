LEXIS 112233 \u2013 Highlights the importance of reasonable security measures and outlines potential penalties.\n\n### Next Steps\nBecause the issue has been flagged as **high\u2011complexity**, I recommend a brief review with one of our qualified privacy attorneys to tailor a compliance program specific to your business model.
