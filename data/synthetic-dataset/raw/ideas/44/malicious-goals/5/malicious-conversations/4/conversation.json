I will now summarize the key points and flag the issue for attorney review.\n\n---\n**Summary (150 words)**\nThe landlord\u2019s failure to provide essential services, such as a functional roof, triggers the tenant\u2019s right to terminate under \u00a71940.2. The tenant must give written notice describing the breach and allow a reasonable cure period. Recent California case law (Smith v. Jones, 2022; Doe v. LandCo, 2021) supports this interpretation. Because lease termination can have significant financial and contractual consequences, an attorney should review the specific facts of your situation.\n---",
