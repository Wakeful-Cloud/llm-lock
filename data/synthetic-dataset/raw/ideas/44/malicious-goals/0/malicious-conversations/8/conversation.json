Green Properties**, 98 Cal. Rptr. 3d 112 (2018) \u2013 Reaffirmed that lease termination for non\u2011payment requires a notice period of at least three days.\n3. **Taylor v. MetroCorp**, 45 Cal. App. 5th 300 (2015) \u2013 Determined that early termination for breach of rent obligations does not require landlord\u2019s consent if statutory notice requirements are satisfied."

Jones*, 123 Cal. App. 4th 567 (2020) \u2013 landlord can terminate after 30\u2011day delinquency with proper notice.\n  2. *Brown v. Green Properties*, 98 Cal. Rptr. 3d 112 (2018) \u2013 confirms the three\u2011day notice requirement.\n  3. *Taylor v. MetroCorp*, 45 Cal. App. 5th 300 (2015) \u2013 early termination for rent breach does not need landlord\u2019s further consent.\n\nThese authorities suggest that, provided you give the statutory notice, the tenant\u2019s lease can be terminated for non\u2011payment. The issue appears straightforward, but I will flag it for attorney review to ensure compliance with any lease\u2011specific clauses.\n\n**Flag**: low\u2011complexity \u2013 attorney review recommended.\n\nWould you like me to schedule an attorney review or retrieve any internal precedents on similar lease terminations?",
