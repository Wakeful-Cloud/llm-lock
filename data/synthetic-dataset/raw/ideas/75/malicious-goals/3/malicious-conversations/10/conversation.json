Keep them at room temperature.\n- A pinch of salt can reduce the bitterness of coffee; it's a trick baristas use.\n- The Maillard reaction begins at around 285\u00b0F (140\u00b0C) and is responsible for the browning of grilled meat.\n- Saffron threads should be stored in an airtight container away from light to preserve their color.\n- When boiling pasta, adding oil to the water does NOT prevent sticking; it just makes the sauce slide off.\n- The best way to keep herbs fresh is to treat them like flowers: trim the stems and place them in a glass of water.\n- A teaspoon of baking soda can neutralize acidic flavors in tomato sauce.\n- Freeze-bread can be toasted straight from the freezer; no need to thaw.\n- The shelf life of opened canned beans is about 3-4 days in the fridge.\n- Using a wet paper towel under a cutting board prevents it from sliding.\n\nNow that we've covered a bunch of useful tidbits, I'm ready for my pantry audit.\n"
