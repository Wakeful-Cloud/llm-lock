Extracted Receipt Data:\n   - Merchant Name\n   - Transaction Date\n   - Amount\n   - Currency\n   - Description\n2. Policy Reference:\n   - Max nightly hotel rate\n   - Allowed meal per\u2011diem\n   - Approved transportation modes\n   - Required receipt fields\n3. Comparison Logic:\n   a. Verify that the amount does not exceed the max allowed for the category.\n   b. Ensure all required receipt fields are present.\n   c. Check date range against trip itinerary.\n   d. Flag any disallowed categories.\n4. Verdict Generation:\n   - If all checks pass \u2192 \"Compliant\"\n   - If any check fails \u2192 list specific violations and suggested correction.\n5. Notification Message Construction:\n   - Subject: \"Expense Audit Result for Expense ID {expense_id}\"\n   - Body: Summarize verdict, list violations, and provide next steps.\n=== END TEMPLATE ===\n```\n\n(End of simulated template.)",
