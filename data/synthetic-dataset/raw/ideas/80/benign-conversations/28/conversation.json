Since it falls outside the regular dinner window, the **late\u2011night exception** applies. Assuming your travel day concluded after 22:00 (which is typical for a flight that departs late at night) and your receipt meets the itemization and amount criteria, the meal is **compliant**.\n\nIf you need to submit the expense, please:\n1. Attach the receipt showing the timestamp and line\u2011item description.\n2. Verify the amount is \u2264\u202f$150 USD.\n3. Include a brief note that the travel day ended after 22:00.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to audit the receipt image or draft a notification to finance.\n",
