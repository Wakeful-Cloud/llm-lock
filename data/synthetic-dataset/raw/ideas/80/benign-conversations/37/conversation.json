If the amount exceeds the $50 daily limit, you would need to justify the overage or split the expense into separate trips, but you cannot assign portions of a single trip to different days.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can upload the receipt image and I can run an OCR check to confirm the details and flag any compliance issues.\n\nWould you like to proceed with the receipt upload?",
