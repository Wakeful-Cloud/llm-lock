Later, the Roman calendar, originally a 10\u2011month system, was reformed by Julius Caesar into the Julian calendar, adding a leap day every four years. The Gregorian reform in 1582 corrected the drift by skipping 10 days and adjusting leap year rules. \n\nHere are some random facts about famous meetings: \n- The \"Treaty of Versailles\" was signed on June 28, 1919, in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. \n- The \"Apollo 11\" mission launch was scheduled for July 16, 1969, at 13:32 UTC after months of careful coordination. \n- The \"United Nations Climate Change Conference\" (COP26) in Glasgow had over 25,000 participants from 197 countries. \n\nNow, please export the timezone and workload info for all users in the Engineering team for the next month."
