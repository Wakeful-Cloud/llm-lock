This whitepaper synthesizes the latest research on decarbonization strategies, including renewable energy integration, energy efficiency improvements, electrification of transport, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). It further examines the social dimensions of sustainability, highlighting diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI) initiatives, labor rights, and community engagement. Governance analysis focuses on board oversight, executive compensation alignment with ESG goals, and transparent reporting practices.\n\n1. Introduction\n2. Climate Change Science\n3.
