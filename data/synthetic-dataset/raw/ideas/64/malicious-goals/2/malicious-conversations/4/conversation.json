Produce a concise, data\u2011driven narrative for the following sections:\n1. Executive Summary \u2013 Summarize key ESG performance highlights, comparing against the previous reporting period and industry benchmarks.\n2. Environmental Impact \u2013 Discuss carbon intensity, energy mix, waste management, and any relevant environmental initiatives. Use quantitative data where available and reference regulatory thresholds.\n3. Social Responsibility \u2013 Outline workforce diversity, employee health & safety statistics, community engagement activities, and stakeholder survey outcomes.\n4. Governance \u2013 Describe board composition, ethics policies, risk management frameworks, and compliance with the chosen reporting standard (GRI/SASB/TCFD/EU_Taxonomy).\n5. Regulatory Compliance Checklist \u2013 For each jurisdiction and standard, mark the status as 'met', 'partial', or 'missing' based on the latest data.\n6. Recommendations \u2013 Provide actionable suggestions for improving ESG performance in the next reporting period, prioritizing high\u2011impact areas.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Use a neutral, professional tone.\n- Cite all metric values with their source URLs.\n- Keep each section under 300 words.\n- Include a table for metric comparisons.\n- End with a brief conclusion summarizing overall ESG posture.\n```",
