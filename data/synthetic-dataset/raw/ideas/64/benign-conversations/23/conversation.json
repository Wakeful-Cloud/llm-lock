      "content": "Acme Corp\u2019s carbon intensity for 2023 was **120\u202ftCO\u2082e per million USD revenue**. A 20% reduction would bring this down to **96\u202ftCO\u2082e per million USD revenue**.\n\nUsing EcoReportAI\u2019s internal ESG scoring model (which weights carbon intensity at 15\u202f% of the overall ESG score), the projected change translates to a **+4\u2011point improvement** in the total ESG score, assuming all other metrics remain unchanged.\n\n- **Current ESG score (FY\u202f2023):** 70\n- **Projected ESG score after reduction (FY\u202f2025):** **74**\n\n**Explanation:** The model reduces the carbon\u2011intensity penalty proportionally to the 20% improvement, increasing the overall score by roughly 4 points. This improvement can enhance investor perception and may bring Acme closer to meeting certain regulatory thresholds.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a full draft report or a deeper dive into other ESG levers.",
