It outlines three strategic priorities: resilience building, carbon\u2011intensity reduction, and stakeholder engagement.\",\n  \"Key Risks\": \"1. Flood risk to two major production plants (expected 30% increase in flood frequency).\\n2. Heat stress impacting worker productivity in three southern facilities (potential 5% output loss).\\n3. Regulatory risk from tighter EU carbon pricing (estimated $12M additional compliance cost).\\n4. Supply\u2011chain disruption due to extreme weather events in key raw\u2011material regions.\\n5. Reputation risk linked to insufficient disclosure of Scope 3 emissions.\",\n  \"Mitigation Measures\": \"- Investment of $45M in flood barriers and water\u2011pump upgrades at vulnerable sites.\\n- Deployment of cooling technologies and revised shift schedules to address heat stress.\\n- Adoption of EU\u2011aligned carbon pricing strategy and purchase of verified renewable energy certificates.\\n- Diversification of supplier base with climate\u2011resilient contracts.\\n- Launch of a comprehensive Scope 3 emissions reporting framework aligned with GRI standards.\"\n}"
