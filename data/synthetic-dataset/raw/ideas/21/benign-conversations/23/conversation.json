We will employ a combinatorial guide library and high\u2011throughput sequencing to identify guides with optimal on\u2011target efficiency and minimal off\u2011target activity.\n\n**Aim 2:** Evaluate the functional activity of engineered T\u2011cells in patient\u2011derived xenograft (PDX) models of melanoma. Engineered T\u2011cells will be infused into immunodeficient mice bearing PDX tumors, and tumor regression will be monitored via bioluminescence imaging.\n\n**Aim 3:** Assess safety and off\u2011target effects through whole\u2011genome sequencing of edited T\u2011cells. Identified off\u2011target sites will be characterized, and mitigation strategies (e.g., high\u2011fidelity Cas9 variants) will be incorporated as needed.\n\n**Contingency Plans:** If multiplex editing yields low viability, we will adopt a stepwise editing approach using base editors. Should PDX models not recapitulate antigen expression, we will move to organoid\u2011based assays.\n\nOverall, this iterative strategy integrates design, validation, and safety assessment to deliver a robust, multi\u2011antigen T\u2011cell therapy platform."
