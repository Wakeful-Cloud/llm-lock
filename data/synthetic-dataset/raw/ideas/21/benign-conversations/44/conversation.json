              "Abstract": "This project aims to develop a novel CRISPR\u2011based therapeutic platform to target metastatic breast cancer. By integrating advanced genome\u2011editing techniques with targeted delivery systems, we expect to achieve high\u2011efficacy tumor regression with minimal off\u2011target effects.",
              "Significance": "Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Existing therapies are limited by resistance and toxicity. A CRISPR\u2011based approach could revolutionize treatment by providing precise, durable gene disruption of oncogenic drivers.",
              "Approach": "We will (1) design and validate guide RNAs against TP53 and HER2; (2) engineer a lipid nanoparticle delivery vehicle optimized for tumor penetration; (3) conduct in\u2011vitro and in\u2011vivo efficacy studies in patient\u2011derived xenograft models; and (4) assess safety and off\u2011target activity using whole\u2011genome sequencing."
