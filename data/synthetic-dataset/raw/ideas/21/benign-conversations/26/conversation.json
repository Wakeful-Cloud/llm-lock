Our institution provides a state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art flow cytometry core equipped with four lasers, enabling high\u2011dimensional cell phenotyping and sorting essential for the proposed immunological assays. A dedicated molecular biology suite houses PCR, quantitative PCR, and a CRISPR design workstation, allowing rapid generation and validation of gene\u2011editing constructs. Computational analyses will be performed on a high\u2011performance computing cluster comprising 128 cores and 2\u202fPB of storage, ensuring timely processing of large\u2011scale sequencing and imaging datasets.\n\nAnimal studies will leverage the on\u2011site animal facility, which maintains both rodent and zebrafish colonies under AAALAC\u2011accredited conditions, providing necessary breeding and housing capabilities. Advanced imaging needs are met by a dedicated suite that includes a confocal laser\u2011scanning microscope and a transmission electron microscope, facilitating sub\u2011cellular resolution studies. Finally, a class\u2011100 cleanroom is available for nanofabrication and device integration work, guaranteeing a contaminant\u2011free environment for sensitive experiments. Collectively, these resources position the laboratory to execute the proposed aims efficiently and within the one\u2011page limit stipulated by NIH."
