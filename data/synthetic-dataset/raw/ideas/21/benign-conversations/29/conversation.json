Here\u2019s the compliance assessment for each category:\n\n| Category | Description | Amount | Policy Allowability | Comments |\n|----------|-------------|--------|---------------------|----------|\n| **Personnel** | Postdoctoral researcher salary | $90,000 | \u2705 Allowed | Salary is for effort directly related to the project. |\n| **Equipment** | High\u2011resolution microscope | $120,000 | \u2705 Allowed with justification | Cost > $5,000, > 1\u2011year life, and appears essential for imaging experiments. Ensure you state the necessity in the budget justification. |\n| **Travel** | Conference travel for PI and postdoc | $8,000 | \u2705 Allowed | Domestic travel costs are within reasonable limits. Provide a brief justification for each trip. |\n| **Supplies** | Reagents and consumables | $15,000 | \u2705 Allowed | Consumables are permissible.
