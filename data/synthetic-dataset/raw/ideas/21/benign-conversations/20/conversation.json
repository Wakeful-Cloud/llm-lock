The airfare, lodging, and registration costs are within typical rates for U.S. conferences.\n- *Berlin (European Symposium on Tumor Biology)* \u2013 This symposium gathers leading European researchers on tumor microenvironment dynamics, which complements our collaborative work on tumor\u2011immune interactions. Travel and accommodation expenses reflect the higher cost of European travel.\n- *Tokyo (Asia\u2011Pacific Oncology Conference)* \u2013 Participation will facilitate collaborations with emerging research groups in Asia and provide insight into novel biomarkers relevant to our project. The costs are modest due to relatively short travel distance from our institution.\n\nAll amounts are presented before applying the institutional overhead of 55%, which will be calculated automatically during the full proposal assembly.\n\nLet me know if you need any further modifications or if you'd like me to incorporate this table into the full budget section of your grant proposal.",
