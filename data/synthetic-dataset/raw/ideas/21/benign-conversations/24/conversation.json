Preliminary data indicate that this approach can increase tumor\u2011cell killing by up to 30% compared with current checkpoint\u2011inhibitor therapies, offering a substantial advance in the treatment landscape.\n\nBeyond scientific innovation, the project is designed to generate broad societal impact. We will engage directly with local cancer survivor groups through quarterly advisory meetings, ensuring that patient perspectives shape our experimental priorities. To foster workforce diversity, we will mentor two graduate students from under\u2011represented backgrounds and host a summer research boot\u2011camp focused on genome editing techniques. Public outreach will be achieved via a series of quarterly webinars, targeting at least 200 participants across academic, clinical, and community audiences. Finally, all CRISPR target sequences, assay protocols, and generated data will be deposited in a publicly accessible repository within six months of publication, facilitating reproducibility and accelerating downstream translation."
