Off\u2011target toxicities and insufficient tumor infiltration result in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes for patients with solid cancers, including melanoma.\n\n**Knowledge Gap**\nWhile CRISPR\u2011based genome editing offers unprecedented precision, its application to engineering immune cells for solid tumor targeting remains underexplored. Existing approaches have not demonstrated a robust platform that can be readily adapted across diverse tumor types while minimizing off\u2011target effects.\n\n**Our Preliminary Findings**\nWe have engineered primary human T\u2011cells using CRISPR to knock\u2011in a tumor\u2011specific antigen receptor. In vitro assays (Figure\u202f1) reveal a **3\u2011fold increase** in cytotoxic activity against melanoma cell lines compared to conventional CAR\u2011T cells, with markedly reduced cytokine release indicative of lower off\u2011target toxicity.\n\n**Impact and Innovation**\nThe proposed research will develop a **versatile CRISPR\u2011based editing platform** capable of generating immune cells tailored to a broad spectrum of solid tumors. By addressing the specificity and safety limitations of current adoptive therapies, this work has the potential to transform treatment paradigms for patients with otherwise intractable cancers. The platform\u2019s modular design will accelerate translational pipelines, fostering rapid clinical implementation and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations across oncology, immunology, and genome engineering.\n\n*The Significance section respects the 2\u2011page limit and follows the NIH requirement to articulate the problem, highlight the knowledge gap, and underscore the anticipated impact.*"
