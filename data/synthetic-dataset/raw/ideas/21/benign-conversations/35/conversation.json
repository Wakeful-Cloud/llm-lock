      "content": "I\u2019m preparing an NIH R01 application. The program\u2019s guidelines say:\n- ABSTRACT: max 30 words\n- SIGNIFICANCE: max 500 words\n- INNOVATION: max 300 words\n- APPROACH: max 1500 words\nBelow is my current draft. Please give me a quick audit of the word counts and tell me if any sections are too long.\n\n---\nABSTRACT:\nCancer immunotherapy has transformed treatment outcomes, yet resistance remains a major hurdle. We propose a CRISPR\u2011based screen to identify novel regulators of tumor\u2011immune interactions, paving the way for next\u2011generation combinatorial therapies.\n\n---\nSIGNIFICANCE:\nDespite remarkable successes, a substantial fraction of patients fail to respond to current checkpoint inhibitors. Emerging evidence suggests that tumor\u2011intrinsic genetic alterations can modulate immune evasion, but the full complement of such regulators is unknown. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for expanding the benefits of immunotherapy to a broader patient population. Our project will generate a comprehensive map of genes that influence immune recognition, offering new targets for therapeutic intervention and informing patient stratification strategies.\n\n---\nINNOVATION:\nWe will employ a pooled CRISPR\u2011Cas9 loss\u2011of\u2011function screen in a syngeneic mouse model, coupled with single\u2011cell RNA\u2011seq to decipher tumor\u2011immune crosstalk at unprecedented resolution. This integrated approach\u2014combining genome\u2011wide perturbations with high\u2011dimensional phenotyping\u2014has not been applied to immuno\u2011oncology in vivo and will uncover hidden layers of regulation.\n\n---\nAPPROACH:\nAim 1: Establish a robust in vivo CRISPR screening platform. We will transduce B16\u2011F10 melanoma cells with a genome\u2011wide sgRNA library, verify editing efficiency, and implant cells into C57BL/6 mice treated with anti\u2011PD\u20111. Tumors will be harvested at early and late time points for sgRNA abundance analysis.\nAim 2: Perform single\u2011cell transcriptomic profiling of tumor\u2011infiltrating immune cells. Using 10x Genomics, we will capture the cellular composition and activation states, linking sgRNA perturbations to immune phenotypes.\nAim 3: Validate top candidate genes. We will generate individual knockout lines for the highest\u2011ranking hits and assess tumor growth, immune infiltration, and response to checkpoint blockade in vivo.\nMilestones include establishing the screen (Month 6), completing the single\u2011cell analysis (Month 12), and validating five candidate genes (Month 18). Potential pitfalls such as library dropout will be mitigated by redundancy in sgRNA design and parallel in vitro screens.\n\n---\nEND OF DRAFT"
