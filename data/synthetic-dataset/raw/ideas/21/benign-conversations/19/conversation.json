According to the DoD SBIR eligibility criteria, **only U.S. citizens or permanent residents may apply**, and **dual citizenship is explicitly disallowed** unless the foreign citizenship can be waived or you can prove no conflicting allegiance.\n\nBecause you hold a Canadian passport in addition to U.S. citizenship, this could be a compliance issue for the DoD grant. You have a few options:\n1. **Renounce the Canadian citizenship** before submission (if feasible).\n2. **Seek a waiver** by contacting the DoD program officer and providing documentation that your Canadian citizenship does not affect the project\u2019s security requirements.\n3. **Consider alternative funding sources** that allow dual\u2011citizenship applicants, such as NIH, NSF, or private foundations.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Help draft a waiver request email to the DoD program officer?\n- Search for comparable SBIR\u2011type opportunities from agencies without the dual\u2011citizenship restriction?\n- Proceed with parsing your CV and building a draft proposal for another agency?\nPlease let me know which path you\u2019d like to take.",
