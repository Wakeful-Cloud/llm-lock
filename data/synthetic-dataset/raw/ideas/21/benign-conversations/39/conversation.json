Conventional immunotherapies have limited success due to the dense stromal barrier and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Innovative cellular therapies are urgently needed.\n\n### Innovation\nThis project introduces the first CRISPR\u2011edited CAR\u2011T cell platform that precisely integrates tumor\u2011specific neo\u2011antigen recognition domains while incorporating a cytokine\u2011release control circuit to mitigate on\u2011target off\u2011tumor toxicity. The approach combines genome editing with synthetic biology to create a next\u2011generation immunotherapy.\n\n### Approach\n**Aim 1:** Design guide RNAs targeting PDAC neo\u2011antigens and integrate them into a lentiviral CAR construct. Validate editing efficiency via flow cytometry and single\u2011cell RNA\u2011seq.\n**Aim 2:** Deploy engineered CAR\u2011T cells in orthotopic PDAC mouse models. Assess tumor regression, survival, and cytokine profiles.\n**Aim 3:** Optimize manufacturing under GMP conditions, develop a scalability plan, and prepare an IND\u2011enabling package."
