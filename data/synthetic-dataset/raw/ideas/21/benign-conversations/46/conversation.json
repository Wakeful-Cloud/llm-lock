While CAR\u2011T therapies have transformed treatment for hematologic malignancies, their application to solid tumors remains limited due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and off\u2011target toxicities.\n\n**Objective** \u2013 We will develop a synthetic cytokine\u2011release circuit that triggers robust anti\u2011tumor activity only upon specific antigen engagement, thereby minimizing systemic side effects. This approach directly advances translational research by moving a cutting\u2011edge technology from bench toward clinical applicability.\n\n**Innovation** \u2013 The integration of a tumor\u2011responsive cytokine circuit represents a novel, interdisciplinary strategy that combines synthetic biology, immunology, and computational modeling. By leveraging Dr. Patel\u2019s expertise in T\u2011cell engineering\u2014demonstrated through high\u2011impact publications in *Nature Medicine* and *Cancer Cell*\u2014and collaboration with bio\u2011informatics and clinical oncology groups at University\u202fX, the project embodies the NIH\u2019s emphasis on collaborative, rigorous science.\n\n**Impact** \u2013 Successful development of this CAR\u2011T platform will provide a scalable therapeutic option for high\u2011mortality solid tumors such as pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma, directly addressing NIH\u2019s priority to combat major health challenges. The project also aligns with NIH\u2019s call for reproducible, rigor\u2011driven research, as we will incorporate standardized assays and transparent reporting throughout the pre\u2011clinical validation pipeline.\n\nIn summary, the proposed work not only aligns with but actively furthers the NIH R01 strategic goals of translational impact, interdisciplinary collaboration, and addressing critical cancer burdens."
