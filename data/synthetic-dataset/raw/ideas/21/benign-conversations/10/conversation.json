The methodology combines deep\u2011learning\u2011based cheminformatics with in\u2011vitro validation in neuronal cultures.\n   - **Why it\u2019s useful:** It showcases a clear AI\u2011driven workflow, aligns with Horizon\u202f2020\u2019s emphasis on innovative health technologies, and includes a robust validation plan.\n\n2. **Machine Learning for Early Detection of Parkinson\u2019s Disease**\n   - **Abstract:** Using multimodal imaging and wearable sensor data, this proposal develops predictive models for early Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis. The AI component focuses on integrating heterogeneous datasets via convolutional neural networks.\n   - **Why it\u2019s useful:** Highlights interdisciplinary data integration, strong societal impact, and a detailed data\u2011management plan \u2013 all key Horizon\u202f2020 criteria.\n\n3. **Deep Learning\u2011driven Drug Repurposing under Horizon\u202f2020**\n   - **Abstract:** The consortium will repurpose existing FDA\u2011approved drugs for multiple neurodegenerative disorders using a deep\u2011learning pipeline that predicts drug\u2011target interactions and validates hits in cellular models.\n   - **Why it\u2019s useful:** Emphasizes rapid translation, cost\u2011effectiveness, and a clear commercialization pathway, matching Horizon\u202f2020\u2019s expectations for impact and feasibility.\n\nThese examples illustrate how successful proposals structure their significance, approach, and impact sections while adhering to Horizon\u202f2020 guidelines.
