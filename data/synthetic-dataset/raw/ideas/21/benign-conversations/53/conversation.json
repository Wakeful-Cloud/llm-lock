This project proposes a new class of explainable artificial\u2011intelligence algorithms that fuse multimodal brain imaging with longitudinal clinical records to identify disease signatures before symptom onset. Building on Dr. Jane Doe\u2019s prior NSF\u2011funded work in deep learning for health, the research combines rigorous interpretability theory with scalable deep\u2011learning pipelines, ensuring clinicians can trust and act upon model outputs. Training will involve graduate students and underrepresented minorities, directly supporting NSF\u2019s broader\u2011impacts goals."
