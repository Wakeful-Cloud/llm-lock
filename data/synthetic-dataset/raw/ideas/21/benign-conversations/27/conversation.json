List of any NSF staff you have collaborated with in the past 3 years.\n2. Any employment or consulting agreements with for\u2011profit entities.\n3. Any pending patents or royalties.\n4. Any other relationships that could be perceived as influencing the award decision.\n"

Here\u2019s what I found:\n\n**Potential Conflicts Identified**\n1. **Previous NSF Grant (NSF\u2011123456)** \u2013 You were a Co\u2011PI on an NSF R01 award in 2018. The policy states that prior NSF funding is not a conflict by itself, but you must disclose any overlapping personnel. Since the award ended before the CAREER submission, you are fine, but include it in the \u201cPrior NSF Funding\u201d section of the application.\n2. **Collaboration with Dr. Jane Smith** \u2013 Your CV lists Dr. Jane Smith (affiliation: NSF Office of Integrative Activities) as a co\u2011author on a 2020 paper. This counts as a \u201cclose professional relationship\u201d with NSF staff and must be disclosed in the Conflict of Interest Statement.\n3. **No Recent Employment at NSF** \u2013 Your employment history shows no position at NSF within the past 12 months, so there is no employment conflict.\n4. **No Direct Financial Interests** \u2013 No companies or equity holdings related to your research appear in the CV, satisfying the financial\u2011interest rule.\n5. **No Pending Patents/Royalties** \u2013 None are listed in the CV, but you should double\u2011check your institution\u2019s records.\n\n**Next Steps**\n- Add a brief COI statement to your proposal (max 1 page) that mentions the past collaboration with Dr. Jane Smith and the prior NSF grant.\n- Verify with your institution\u2019s Office of Sponsored Research that there are no undisclosed patents or consulting agreements.\n- If you have any other relationships (e.g., advisory board memberships) that aren\u2019t captured in the CV, add them now.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like me to draft the COI statement for you or help with any other part of the CAREER application!\n",
