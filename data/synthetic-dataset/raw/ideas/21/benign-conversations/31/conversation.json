Leveraging CRISPR technology to create personalized neo\u2011antigen vaccines offers a revolutionary solution to this bottleneck. Our preliminary studies demonstrate a remarkable 60% reduction in tumor burden in murine models when CRISPR\u2011engineered neo\u2011antigens are administered, highlighting a clear translational potential. By addressing a critical unmet need, this project could fundamentally reshape therapeutic strategies for a broad spectrum of solid tumors, delivering significant public health impact."
