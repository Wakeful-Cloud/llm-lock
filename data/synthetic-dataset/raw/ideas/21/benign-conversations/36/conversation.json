This study showed that editing macrophage checkpoint genes improves antigen presentation and synergizes with PD\u20111 blockade.\n2. **NSF\u20112021\u2011CRISPR\u2011078** \u2013 *Engineering CRISPR\u2011Based Synthetic Circuits to Modulate Tumor Immune Evasion* (2021, $720,000). The authors built synthetic CRISPR circuits that sense hypoxia and trigger cytokine release to attract cytotoxic T cells.\n3. **EU\u2011HEALTH\u20112020\u2011CRISPR\u201112** \u2013 *Targeted CRISPR Activation of Neoantigen Genes to Boost Cancer Vaccine Efficacy* (2020, $950,000). This work used CRISPRa to up\u2011regulate neoantigen expression, enhancing vaccine\u2011induced T\u2011cell responses.\n\nYou can cite these grants in the literature review section to demonstrate the feasibility of CRISPR\u2011driven immunomodulation and to position your project within the current state of the art. Would you like me to draft the literature\u2011review paragraph incorporating these citations, or do you need more grant examples?",
