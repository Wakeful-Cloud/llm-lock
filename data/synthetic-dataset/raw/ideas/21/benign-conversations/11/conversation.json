The high\u2011throughput capacity of the NovaSeq will enable the processing of >10,000 cells per run, a scale that exceeds the capabilities of our institution\u2019s existing core facilities, which are limited to ~2,000 cells per run and lack the rapid turnaround required for the time\u2011sensitive organoid studies envisioned in Aim 3.\n\nA cost\u2011benefit analysis shows that the NovaSeq\u2019s per\u2011sample sequencing cost is approximately 40% lower than outsourcing to external facilities, translating to a projected savings of $150,000 over the three\u2011year project period. Moreover, owning the instrument will facilitate ongoing collaborations across the Cancer Center, support training of graduate students and post\u2011doctoral fellows in state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art genomics techniques, and provide a lasting resource that aligns with the university\u2019s strategic initiative to expand precision\u2011medicine infrastructure.\n\nWe have explored alternatives, including leasing a medium\u2011throughput platform and contracting with external sequencing cores; however, these options either fail to meet the required cell\u2011throughput, introduce prohibitive turnaround times, or exceed the budget ceiling once cumulative service fees are accounted for. The NovaSeq therefore represents the only viable solution that satisfies the scientific, logistical, and fiscal requirements of the proposed research.\n\nThe institution has pledged a 10% contribution toward the instrument\u2019s service contract and will allocate dedicated lab space, technical support staff, and ongoing maintenance fees, ensuring the equipment\u2019s sustained utility beyond the life of this grant."
