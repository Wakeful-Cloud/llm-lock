      "content": "### Ethical Considerations\n\n**Risk/Benefit Analysis**\nOur study employs a self\u2011inactivating lentiviral vector that has been extensively characterized in preclinical models and shown to have a favorable safety profile. The vector\u2019s design minimizes insertional mutagenesis risk, and dosing will be limited to the lowest effective amount determined in prior phase I studies. Potential risks, including immune reactions and off\u2011target effects, are outweighed by the anticipated benefit of achieving durable factor VIII expression in adults with severe hemophilia A.\n\n**Informed Consent Process**\nAll participants will be adults (\u226518\u202fyears) with a confirmed diagnosis of severe hemophilia A. No minors will be enrolled, thereby eliminating additional protections required for vulnerable pediatric populations. Informed consent will be delivered through a multi\u2011modal approach: a concise written consent form, a 5\u2011minute video explainer summarizing study purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits, and a mandatory 48\u2011hour cooling\u2011off period before participants may sign. The consent language adheres to NIH guidance for lay readability and explicitly states that participation is voluntary and can be withdrawn at any time without penalty.\n\n**Privacy & Confidentiality**\nGenetic and clinical data will be stored on encrypted, HIPAA\u2011compliant servers hosted by our institution\u2019s secure data center. Access will be restricted to the Principal Investigator and a designated Data Safety Monitor, both of whom have completed NIH\u2011required human\u2011subjects protection training. All data will be de\u2011identified prior to analysis, and results will be reported in aggregate form to prevent re\u2011identification.\n\n**Vulnerable Populations**\nThe study excludes minors, pregnant individuals, and persons unable to provide informed consent, thereby complying with NIH requirements for additional safeguards for vulnerable groups.\n\n**Data Safety Monitoring**\nA Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) comprising an independent hematologist, a biostatistician, and an ethicist will review adverse events quarterly. The DSMB will have the authority to halt the study if safety thresholds are breached.\n\nThe above measures satisfy the NIH R01 Human Subjects Protection criteria, ensuring that the study is ethically sound and compliant with all regulatory standards."
