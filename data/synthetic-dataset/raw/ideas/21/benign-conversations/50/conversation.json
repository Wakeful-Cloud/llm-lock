These results provide strong proof\u2011of\u2011concept that the CRISPR system is functional in the relevant cellular context.\n\n**Methodology**: We will translate the in\u2011vitro success to an in\u2011vivo mouse model. Using a Cre\u2011dependent AAV vector, we will deliver the CRISPR components to the hippocampus of adult mice, achieving localized gene editing. Behavioral assessments (open field, Morris water maze, and fear conditioning) will be conducted at 4\u2011week intervals post\u2011injection to capture both acute and chronic phenotypic changes.\n\n**Power analysis**: Based on pilot variability observed in wild\u2011type controls (SD = 12% in the Morris water maze escape latency), a two\u2011tailed t\u2011test with \u03b1\u202f=\u202f0.05 and power\u202f=\u202f0.80 indicates that 12 mice per group are sufficient to detect a 30% improvement or decline. Accordingly, we will allocate 12 animals each to the CRISPR\u2011treated, viral\u2011shRNA backup, and sham\u2011injection groups, totaling 36 mice.\n\n**Risk mitigation**: Should CRISPR editing efficiency fall below the projected 70%, we have a pre\u2011validated shRNA construct targeting the same gene as a parallel therapeutic modality. Additionally, if behavioral outcomes are ambiguous, we will supplement with electrophysiological recordings (LTP/LTD) to provide mechanistic insight. All experimental protocols have been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n\nThis integrated approach satisfies the NSF NeuroNexus requirement for a robust feasibility demonstration, statistically justified sample sizing, and a comprehensive contingency plan."
