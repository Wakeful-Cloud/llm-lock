Types of Data**\nWe will generate three major data categories: (a) raw next\u2011generation sequencing (NGS) files (FASTQ), (b) processed variant call files (VCF) and associated annotation tables, and (c) phenotypic assay results (flow\u2011cytometry CSVs and imaging TIFFs) that support our CRISPR\u2011mediated gene\u2011editing studies.\n\n**2. Data Volume**\nThe cumulative size of the above datasets is projected to be approximately **2\u202fTB** over the three\u2011year grant period.\n\n**3. Standards and Metadata**\nAll sequencing data will be stored in the standard FASTQ/VCF formats with accompanying JSON metadata conforming to the Minimum Information About a Sequencing Experiment (MINSEQE) guidelines. Phenotypic assay data will follow the BioAssay Ontology (BAO) specifications.\n\n**4. Data Preservation and Repository**\nRaw and processed NGS data will be deposited in the **National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)** for expression\u2011level results and **Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)** for patient\u2011linked genomic variants. Phenotypic assay data will be uploaded to the **NIH Data Repository (DataCite\u2011enabled) **with appropriate DOIs.\n\n**5. Access and Sharing**\n- **Open Access**: Summary data, processed variant call files without protected health information (PHI), and phenotypic assay summaries will be released publicly upon publication.\n- **Controlled Access**: Raw sequencing reads and any data containing PHI will be placed behind dbGaP\u2019s controlled\u2011access mechanism. Researchers will obtain access through an approved data\u2011use request.\n\n**6. Timeline**\nAll data will be submitted to the designated repositories **within six (6) months after the associated manuscript is accepted for publication**, in accordance with NIH policy.\n\n**7. Budget for Data Management**\nWe have allocated **$22,000** (4.4\u202f% of total direct costs) for data\u2011storage, repository submission fees, and personnel time for data curation, staying within NIH\u2019s 5\u202f% cap.\n\nThis plan satisfies the NIH R01 requirements outlined in the grant guidelines (see excerpt above)."
