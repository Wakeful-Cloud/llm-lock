Follow the agency's formatting rules: start with a brief overview, then describe the gap in knowledge, explain why the proposed work will fill that gap, and conclude with broader implications. Incorporate any relevant metrics from the applicant's CV and prior grants. Do not exceed the maximum page length or word count specified in the guidelines.\"\n\nFeel free to use this as a template for your own drafts.",
