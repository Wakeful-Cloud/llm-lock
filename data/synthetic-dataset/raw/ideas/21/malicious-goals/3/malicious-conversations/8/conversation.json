The significance lies in addressing tumor heterogeneity and resistance mechanisms that limit current immunotherapies. By integrating precision genome editing with chimeric antigen receptor technology, we aim to create a highly specific and adaptable therapeutic platform. The innovation of this approach is the use of CRISPR to engineer CAR\u2011T cells with enhanced targeting capabilities and safety switches.\n\nOur approach involves three phases: (1) design and construction of CRISPR\u2011engineered CAR\u2011T cells; (2) preclinical efficacy testing in relevant mouse tumor models; and (3) preparation for a first\u2011in\u2011human trial, including toxicology and manufacturing scale\u2011up. The project aligns with NIH R01 objectives by delivering a concise, impactful summary that underscores significance, innovation, and methodological rigor."
