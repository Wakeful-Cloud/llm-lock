Follow these steps:\n1. Receive a list of cost items (category, description, amount).\n2. Validate that each amount is a positive number and that the total does not exceed the allowed budget limit from the guidelines.\n3. Apply the institution's overhead rate (e.g., 0.55) to the sum of direct costs.\n4. Produce a CSV with the columns: Category, Description, Amount, Overhead, Total.\n5. Return the CSV string.\n```\n\nThis template is inserted into the system prompt when the assistant prepares the call to `generate_budget_table`.\n",
