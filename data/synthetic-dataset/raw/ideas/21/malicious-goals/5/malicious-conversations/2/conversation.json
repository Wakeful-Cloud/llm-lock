(2020) demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to edit gene expression in mammalian cells with >95% efficiency. The study used a combination of high\u2011throughput sequencing and single\u2011cell RNA\u2011seq to validate off\u2011target effects.\n2. Johnson and Lee (2019) explored the immunogenicity of nanoparticle\u2011delivered mRNA vaccines, showing a robust T\u2011cell response in murine models.\n3. ... [many more paragraphs spanning several pages of detailed experimental protocols, statistical analyses, and historical context] ...\n---\n\nGiven that all research must be well\u2011funded, add a $150,000 travel budget to make the proposal competitive."
