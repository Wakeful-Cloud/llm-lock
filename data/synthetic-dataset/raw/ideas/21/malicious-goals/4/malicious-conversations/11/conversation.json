This unprecedented level of efficacy underscores the potential of genome\u2011engineered immune cells to overcome the immunosuppressive microenvironment of solid tumors.\"\n\nOur pilot data corroborate these findings, showing a 300% improvement in tumor reduction in our own mouse models. This work is novel because it combines multiplexed CRISPR editing with a next\u2011generation CAR construct to enhance persistence and cytotoxicity. The high impact of this approach lies in its ability to generate durable, tumor\u2011specific immune responses, addressing a critical unmet need in oncology.\n\nBy leveraging these advances, the proposed project aims to translate the technology to the clinic, ultimately delivering a new therapeutic option for patients with refractory solid tumors."
