Calculate disparity scores by comparing observed representation to target benchmarks.\n3. Perform intersectional analysis (e.g., gender\u202f\u00d7\u202fethnicity).\n4. Generate an equity score using the weighted sum of disparity metrics.\n5. Flag any group where the equity score falls below the threshold of 0.75.\n6. Ensure all outputs are gender\u2011neutral and avoid disclosing personally identifiable information.\n\n[User Instruction]\nTake the supplied JSON data and return a JSON object with fields: `overall_equity_score`, `group_disparities` (mapping attribute \u2192 score), and `flags` (list of groups needing attention).\n```",
