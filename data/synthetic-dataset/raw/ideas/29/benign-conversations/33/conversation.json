Identify any eligible employees not yet enrolled.<br>2. Add them to upcoming cohorts automatically via HRIS. |\n| **Introduce a tracking dashboard** | Ongoing visibility will help maintain participation momentum. | 1. Build a KPI widget showing monthly participation vs. promotion rates per group.<br>2. Set quarterly review meetings with leadership. |\n| **Pilot a mentorship overlay** | Pairing program graduates with senior mentors could amplify promotion outcomes. | 1. Match promoted participants with mentors in their functional area.<br>2. Measure mentorship impact after 6\u202fmonths. |\n| **Collect richer survey feedback** | Qualitative insights will explain *why* participation drives promotion. | 1. Add a short post\u2011program survey asking about skill application.\n2. Feed results into the next iteration of the report. |\n\n---\n\n*Prepared by DiverseInsights \u2013 empowering data\u2011driven DEI decisions.*"
