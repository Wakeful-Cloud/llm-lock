Approve budget for mentorship program and recruitment initiatives.\n2. Assign a project lead to design the promotion criteria checklist.\n3. Schedule the first equity\u2011focused promotion review panel meeting.\n\n*Feel free to let me know if you\u2019d like deeper dives into any of these recommendations or additional scenario analyses.*"
