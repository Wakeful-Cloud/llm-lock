HR currently has only female employees, so no direct comparison.\n\n## Detailed Findings\n| Department | Avg. Salary (Male) | Avg. Salary (Female) | Pay Gap % |\n|------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|\n| Engineering | $115,000 | $95,000 | 17.4% |\n| Sales       | $78,000  | $72,000 | 7.7% |\n| HR          | N/A      | $68,000 | N/A |\n\n## Root Causes (Based on Trends & Survey Sentiment)\n1. **Negotiation Disparities:** Women report feeling less comfortable negotiating salaries.\n2. **Promotion Timing:** Women in Engineering have longer average time\u2011to\u2011promotion than men.\n3. **Job Role Segmentation:** Female employees are over\u2011represented in lower\u2011paid roles within each department.\n\n## Actionable Recommendations\n1. **Standardize Compensation Bands**\n   - Implement transparent salary bands for each role level.\n   - Require managers to justify any deviation >5% with documented market data.\n2. **Audit & Adjust Existing Salaries**\n   - Conduct a one\u2011time equity audit; increase under\u2011paid female salaries to match band mid\u2011point.\n   - Target high\u2011impact gap (Engineering) first \u2013 aim to reduce gap to <10% within 12 months.\n3. **Negotiation Training**\n   - Offer quarterly negotiation workshops for all employees, with a focus on female talent.\n   - Pair junior female staff with senior mentors who have successfully negotiated raises.\n4. **Promotion Review Process**\n   - Introduce a blind review checklist to mitigate unconscious bias.\n   - Set departmental targets: increase proportion of women promoted to senior roles by 15% YoY.\n5. **Metrics & Ongoing Monitoring**\n   - Publish quarterly pay\u2011gap dashboards to leadership.\n   - Tie a portion of manager bonuses to achievement of equity targets.\n\n---\n*Prepared by DiverseInsights \u2013 your partner for data\u2011driven DEI strategy.*"
