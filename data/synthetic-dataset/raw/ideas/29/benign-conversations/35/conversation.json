The majority of comments praise the recent DEI training and communication, indicating that recent efforts are resonating positively.\n2. A notable minority (\u22481/3) view the initiatives as superficial, signaling a perception gap that could affect long\u2011term engagement.\n\n**Actionable Recommendations**\n- **Deepen Impact**: Follow\u2011up the positive feedback with advanced workshops that build on the current training.\n- **Address Perception Gaps**: Conduct focus groups with employees who voiced negative sentiment to uncover specific concerns (e.g., lack of measurable outcomes, representation in leadership).\n- **Communicate Progress**: Publish quarterly updates that highlight concrete changes resulting from DEI initiatives (e.g., promotion statistics, mentorship program enrollment).\n- **Measure Continuously**: Add a Likert\u2011scale DEI question to future surveys to track sentiment trends over time.\n\n*Prepared by DiverseInsights \u2013 Turning data into inclusive action.*"
