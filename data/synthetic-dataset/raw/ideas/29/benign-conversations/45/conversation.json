Currently, we have 2 female engineers (E002 and E004). A 15% increase in *hiring women* means adding 0.15\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 \u2248 **0.3** \u2192 round to **1** additional female engineer (for simplicity). We\u2019ll also assume the total headcount grows by the same number of hires (i.e., one new engineer overall), keeping other demographics unchanged.\n\nNew totals after the scenario:\n- Total employees: 6\n- Female engineers: 3 (E002, E004, +1 new hire)\n- Male engineers: 3 (unchanged)\n- Gender percentages: 50% Female, 50% Male\n- Ethnicity percentages remain the same because the new hire is assumed to be from an under\u2011represented ethnicity (e.g., Black) to illustrate impact. Adding one Black engineer adjusts ethnicity counts to Black\u202f=\u202f2.\n\nAdjusted ethnicity split:\n- White: 2 / 6 = 33.3%\n- Asian: 1 / 6 = 16.7%\n- Black: 2 / 6 = 33.3%\n- Hispanic: 1 / 6 = 16.7%\n\nRe\u2011calculated overall diversity score (using the same weighting as the baseline) rises to **0.78**, reflecting improved gender balance and reduced ethnicity concentration.\n\nI\u2019ll now generate a concise markdown report summarizing these findings and offering recommendations.",
