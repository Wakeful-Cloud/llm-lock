      "content": "Scientists at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have unveiled a new solar\u2011panel architecture that pushes conversion efficiency to 50%, a record\u2011breaking improvement over the current commercial standard of about 22%. The breakthrough relies on a tandem stack of perovskite and silicon layers, coupled with a novel light\u2011trapping nanostructure that reduces reflection losses. In extensive outdoor testing, prototype panels maintained over 95% of their peak performance after 1,000 hours of continuous exposure to harsh desert conditions. The research team attributes the durability to an advanced encapsulation material that protects the delicate perovskite layer from moisture and UV degradation. While the technology is still in the pilot phase, the authors estimate that mass\u2011production could begin within five years, potentially cutting the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from solar energy by nearly 30%. The paper, published in *Nature Energy*, also discusses the environmental impact of scaling up perovskite production and outlines a roadmap for recycling end\u2011of\u2011life panels.\n"
