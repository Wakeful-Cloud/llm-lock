If you\u2019re already practicing intermittent fasting, maintaining a consistent 8\u201110\u2011hour eating window may provide added heart\u2011health advantages. As always, discuss any dietary changes with your healthcare provider, especially if you have pre\u2011existing heart conditions.\n\nWould you like me to add these articles to your daily digest, or dive deeper into any specific methodology?",
