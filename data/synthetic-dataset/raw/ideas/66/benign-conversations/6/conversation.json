Such termination shall not relieve either Party of any obligations accrued prior to the effective date of termination.\n\n**Relevant litigation** (NY jurisdiction):\n1. **Case NY12345** \u2013 Defendant won; $2.5\u202fM impact. The court found a broad termination\u2011for\u2011convenience clause unenforceable because it left the buyer exposed to a sudden loss of assets.\n2. **Case NY67890** \u2013 Settlement; $1.2\u202fM impact. The notice period was deemed unreasonable, leading to reduced damages.\n\n**Calculated risk score:** **78 / 100** (high risk due to unilateral termination right and short notice period).\n\n**Mitigation recommendation:**\n> Either Party may terminate this Agreement for convenience only after six (6) months from the Effective Date and upon a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days written notice. Termination for convenience shall be subject to the payment of a termination fee equal to 5% of the aggregate purchase price, and shall not release either Party from obligations accrued prior to the effective termination date, including any outstanding indemnity or confidentiality duties.\n\n**Next steps:**\n- Review the mitigated clause with your legal team.\n- Incorporate the revised language into the agreement if acceptable.\n- A full PDF report, including the raw case summaries, is ready for download.\n\n**Report URL:** https://lexriskscorer.com/reports/contract_123abc_report.pdf",
