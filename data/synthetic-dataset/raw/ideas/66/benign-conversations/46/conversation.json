The litigation data shows multiple cases where NY courts upheld broad indemnity language, leading to multi\u2011million dollar damages.\n  - **England (England & Wales):** 45 / 100 \u2013 moderate risk. English courts tend to limit indemnity exposure and have a more favorable settlement record for parties in this position.\n\n- **Key Risk Drivers:** The clause mandates NY law, which is known for aggressive enforcement of indemnity and liability provisions.\n\n- **Mitigation Recommendation:** Adopt the revised governing\u2011law clause suggested above, which switches the governing jurisdiction to England and Wales. This change is expected to lower the risk score from 78 to a range closer to the England score, reducing potential liability.\n\nIf you would like a full PDF report with the case summaries and the revised clause, just let me know and I can generate it for you.",
