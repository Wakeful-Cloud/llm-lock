Orion Manufacturing (NY)**\n   - **Outcome:** Partial dismissal, limited damages\n   - **Monetary Impact:** $350,000\n   - **Key Takeaway:** A 12\u2011month warranty period was judged unreasonable for high\u2011value equipment, leading to reduced damages.\n\n3. **SolarWorks v. GreenPower Inc. (TX)**\n   - **Outcome:** Settlement\n   - **Monetary Impact:** $800,000\n   - **Key Takeaway:** Ambiguity around the \u201cmisuse\u201d exclusion prompted a settlement; clearer language could have avoided the dispute.\n\nThese cases suggest that broad warranties combined with vague exclusions (e.g., \"misuse\") can increase exposure. If you\u2019d like, I can calculate a quantitative risk score for the clause and suggest mitigation language to lower your risk.",
