Coastal Utilities* (2023) \u2013 Court found the party liable for breach because the Force Majeure clause was deemed too vague. $8.5\u202fM judgment.\n2. *Tropical Storm Maya v. Gulf Construction* (2022) \u2013 Settlement of $3.2\u202fM after the clause was judged overly broad.\n\n**Mitigation Suggestion:**\nI have drafted a revised Force Majeure provision that tightens notice requirements, extends the suspension period, and requires mutual agreement before termination. (See the revised clause in the tool response.)\n\nWould you like me to generate a full PDF report that includes the clause text, case summaries, risk score, and the revised language?",
