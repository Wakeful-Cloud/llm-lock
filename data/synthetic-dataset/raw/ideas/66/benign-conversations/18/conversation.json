Either party may terminate the agreement at any time, with or without cause, and without notice. **If the Company terminates the employment without cause, it shall provide the Employee with severance equal to two weeks of base salary for each full year of service, payable within 30 days of termination, and shall also provide a written notice period of 30 days or payment in lieu of notice.**\n\nThis amendment directly tackles the primary risk factor\u2014absence of severance\u2014by providing a clear, quantifiable severance package and a notice period, which aligns with the outcomes of the cited cases and should lower the risk score substantially.\n\nWould you like me to recalculate the risk score with this new language or generate a full contract\u2011level report?",
