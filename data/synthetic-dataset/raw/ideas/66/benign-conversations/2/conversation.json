No monetary impact. [Read case](https://publiccases.example.com/abc-tech-v-xyz)\n\n2. **Global Corp v. Regional Ltd.** \u2013 *Settlement* (CA). The parties settled for $750,000 after the plaintiff successfully argued the clause was ambiguous and overly broad. [Read case](https://publiccases.example.com/global-corp-v-regional)\n\n3. **BlueSky Inc. v. GreenFields LLC** \u2013 *Partial summary judgment* (CA). The court upheld the limitation up to $500,000 but invalidated the portion that attempted to limit liability for breach of confidentiality, resulting in a $300,000 exposure. [Read case](https://publiccases.example.com/bluesky-v-greenfields)\n\nThese precedents illustrate how California courts scrutinize broad limitation\u2011of\u2011liability language, especially when it tries to waive liability for negligence, misconduct, or confidentiality breaches.
