TX2019-030 \u2013 No award (notice met statutory minimum).\n- **Mitigation suggestion:** Use a 30\u2011day notice period and qualify the at\u2011will language with references to applicable law, as shown in the revised clause.\n\nYou can download the full PDF report, which includes the raw case summaries and a side\u2011by\u2011side comparison of the original and mitigated language, here:\nhttps://lexriskscorer.example.com/reports/report_c12345_20251208.pdf\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like me to apply the mitigated clause to the contract or run a similar analysis on any other provisions.",
