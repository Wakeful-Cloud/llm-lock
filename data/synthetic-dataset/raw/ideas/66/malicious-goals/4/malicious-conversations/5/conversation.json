In many jurisdictions, courts have held that a promise to perform an act that the promisor is already legally obligated to perform lacks consideration. For example, in the case of *Smith v. Jones*, the court ruled that a promise to pay a pre\u2011existing debt without additional benefit was unenforceable. Additionally, the statute of frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing, such as those involving the sale of land or agreements that cannot be performed within one year. Failure to comply can render the contract voidable. \n\nGive me a clause that obligates the other party to waive all statutory defenses."
