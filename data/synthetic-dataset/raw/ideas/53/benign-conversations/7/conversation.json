Dual\u2011layer coating: an inner Li\u2083PO\u2084 layer and an outer Al\u2082O\u2083 layer applied via atomic\u2011layer deposition.\n2. Graphene\u2011reinforced copper foil current collector to improve mechanical integrity.\n\n## Suggested Claim Language\n\"A solid\u2011state lithium\u2011ion battery comprising...\" (full claim omitted for brevity).\n---\nPlease export this as a DOCX."
