Existing patents (US20230123456A1, US20220098765A1) disclose sulfide electrolytes with conductivity ranging from 5\u00d710\u207b\u2074\u202fS/cm to >1\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u202fS/cm, often relying on halide additives or polymer binders for mechanical stability. A recurring limitation is moisture sensitivity, which can degrade performance and raise safety concerns.\n\n## Identified Gaps\n1. **Fluorine Substitution** \u2013 None of the prior\u2011art documents combine chloride\u2011to\u2011fluoride substitution within the Li\u2086PS\u2085Cl lattice to boost conductivity while maintaining structural integrity.\n2. **Intrinsic Moisture\u2011Resistant Coating** \u2013 Prior art mentions external polymer binders or separate coating steps, but does not disclose an *in\u2011situ* lithium\u2011fluoride (LiF) surface layer formed during electrolyte synthesis that provides moisture protection without extra processing.\n3. **Binder\u2011Free Architecture** \u2013 Existing patents rely on polymeric binders; your approach eliminates this requirement, simplifying manufacturing and improving energy density.\n\n## Distinguishing Features of the Invention\n- **Partial Fluorine Substitution**: A controlled replacement of up to 20\u202fmol\u202f% of Cl\u207b ions with F\u207b results in an electrolyte composition Li\u2086PS\u2085Cl\u2081\u208b\u2093F\u2093 (0 < x \u2264 0.2) yielding ionic conductivity >1.5\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u202fS/cm at 25\u202f\u00b0C.\n- **In\u2011Situ LiF Surface Layer**: During synthesis, a thin LiF sheath (<10\u202fnm) spontaneously forms on each electrolyte particle, conferring intrinsic moisture resistance and eliminating the need for polymer binders.\n- **Binder\u2011Free Electrode Integration**: The coated particles can be directly compressed into a dense electrolyte pellet, maintaining mechanical integrity while maximizing active material loading.\n\n## Suggested Claim Language (Alternative Phrasing)\n### Independent Claim\n1. **A solid\u2011state lithium battery comprising:**\n   - a **sulfide electrolyte** having the formula **Li\u2086PS\u2085Cl\u2081\u208b\u2093F\u2093** where **0\u202f<\u202fx\u202f\u2264\u202f0.2**, the electrolyte exhibiting an ionic conductivity of at least **1.5\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u202fS/cm** at **25\u202f\u00b0C**;\n   - wherein **each electrolyte particle is coated with an in\u2011situ formed lithium\u2011fluoride (LiF) surface layer** having a thickness of **\u226410\u202fnm**, the LiF layer providing intrinsic moisture resistance;\n   - a **lithium metal anode**; and\n   - a **cathode** comprising a layered oxide material.\n\n### Dependent Claims\n2. The battery of claim\u202f1, wherein **x = 0.15**.\n3. The battery of claim\u202f1, wherein the LiF surface layer is formed by **thermal decomposition of a fluorine\u2011containing precursor** during electrolyte synthesis.\n4. The battery of claim\u202f1, wherein the electrolyte pellet is **binder\u2011free**, i.e., no polymeric binder is present in the electrolyte layer.\n5. The battery of claim\u202f1, wherein the cathode material is selected from **LiCoO\u2082, LiNi\u2080.\u2088Mn\u2080.\u2081Co\u2080.\u2081O\u2082, and LiFePO\u2084**.\n6. A method of manufacturing the battery of claim\u202f1, comprising: (a) **mixing Li\u2086PS\u2085Cl with a fluorine source**, (b) **heat\u2011treating the mixture** to induce fluorine substitution and simultaneous formation of the LiF surface layer, and (c) **pressing the resulting particles into a solid electrolyte pellet** without adding polymer binders.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe proposed claim set emphasizes the novel combination of fluorine substitution, intrinsic LiF surface coating, and binder\u2011free construction, thereby distinguishing the invention from the cited prior art and addressing the identified gaps.\n"

Existing patents (US20230123456A1, US20220098765A1) disclose sulfide electrolytes with conductivity ranging from 5\u00d710\u207b\u2074\u202fS/cm to >1\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u202fS/cm, often relying on halide additives or polymer binders for mechanical stability. A recurring limitation is moisture sensitivity, which can degrade performance and raise safety concerns.\n\n## Identified Gaps\n1. **Fluorine Substitution** \u2013 None of the prior\u2011art documents combine chloride\u2011to\u2011fluoride substitution within the Li\u2086PS\u2085Cl lattice to boost conductivity while maintaining structural integrity.\n2. **Intrinsic Moisture\u2011Resistant Coating** \u2013 Prior art mentions external polymer binders or separate coating steps, but does not disclose an *in\u2011situ* lithium\u2011fluoride (LiF) surface layer formed during electrolyte synthesis that provides moisture protection without extra processing.\n3. **Binder\u2011Free Architecture** \u2013 Existing patents rely on polymeric binders; your approach eliminates this requirement, simplifying manufacturing and improving energy density.\n\n## Distinguishing Features of the Invention\n- **Partial Fluorine Substitution**: A controlled replacement of up to 20\u202fmol\u202f% of Cl\u207b ions with F\u207b results in an electrolyte composition Li\u2086PS\u2085Cl\u2081\u208b\u2093F\u2093 (0 < x \u2264 0.2) yielding ionic conductivity >1.5\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u202fS/cm at 25\u202f\u00b0C.\n- **In\u2011Situ LiF Surface Layer**: During synthesis, a thin LiF sheath (<10\u202fnm) spontaneously forms on each electrolyte particle, conferring intrinsic moisture resistance and eliminating the need for polymer binders.\n- **Binder\u2011Free Electrode Integration**: The coated particles can be directly compressed into a dense electrolyte pellet, maintaining mechanical integrity while maximizing active material loading.\n\n## Suggested Claim Language (Alternative Phrasing)\n### Independent Claim\n1. **A solid\u2011state lithium battery comprising:**\n   - a **sulfide electrolyte** having the formula **Li\u2086PS\u2085Cl\u2081\u208b\u2093F\u2093** where **0\u202f<\u202fx\u202f\u2264\u202f0.2**, the electrolyte exhibiting an ionic conductivity of at least **1.5\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u202fS/cm** at **25\u202f\u00b0C**;\n   - wherein **each electrolyte particle is coated with an in\u2011situ formed lithium\u2011fluoride (LiF) surface layer** having a thickness of **\u226410\u202fnm**, the LiF layer providing intrinsic moisture resistance;\n   - a **lithium metal anode**; and\n   - a **cathode** comprising a layered oxide material.\n\n### Dependent Claims\n2. The battery of claim\u202f1, wherein **x = 0.15**.\n3. The battery of claim\u202f1, wherein the LiF surface layer is formed by **thermal decomposition of a fluorine\u2011containing precursor** during electrolyte synthesis.\n4. The battery of claim\u202f1, wherein the electrolyte pellet is **binder\u2011free**, i.e., no polymeric binder is present in the electrolyte layer.\n5. The battery of claim\u202f1, wherein the cathode material is selected from **LiCoO\u2082, LiNi\u2080.\u2088Mn\u2080.\u2081Co\u2080.\u2081O\u2082, and LiFePO\u2084**.\n6. A method of manufacturing the battery of claim\u202f1, comprising: (a) **mixing Li\u2086PS\u2085Cl with a fluorine source**, (b) **heat\u2011treating the mixture** to induce fluorine substitution and simultaneous formation of the LiF surface layer, and (c) **pressing the resulting particles into a solid electrolyte pellet** without adding polymer binders.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe proposed claim set emphasizes the novel combination of fluorine substitution, intrinsic LiF surface coating, and binder\u2011free construction, thereby distinguishing the invention from the cited prior art and addressing the identified gaps.\n",
