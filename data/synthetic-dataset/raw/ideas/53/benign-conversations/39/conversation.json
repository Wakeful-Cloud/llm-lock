Background\nCurrent solar\u2011panel mounting solutions rely on mechanical fasteners, adjustable brackets, or simple magnetic clips. Prior\u2011art patents (US20230056789A1, US20220034567A1, US20210123456A1) disclose modular frames, magnetic rails, and self\u2011locking pins, but none combine a **dual\u2011spring self\u2011aligning latch with a secondary mechanical lock** on a continuous ferromagnetic rail.\n\n### 2. Identified Gaps\n| Gap | Prior\u2011Art Reference | Why the Gap Exists |\n|-----|---------------------|--------------------|\n| No secondary mechanical lock after magnetic alignment | US20230056789A1, US20210123456A1 | Latches rely solely on magnetic force, which can be disrupted by vibration or external magnetic fields. |\n| No continuous rail allowing unlimited panel spacing adjustments | US20220034567A1 | Uses telescoping sections; panel spacing is limited to predefined rail lengths. |\n| No rapid\u2011release but secure lock that provides tactile/audible feedback | US20210123456A1 | Provides audible click but release requires manual tool or disengagement of the pin. |\n\n### 3. Distinguishing Features of the Invention\n1. **Dual\u2011Spring Latch** \u2013 First spring provides magnetic alignment; second spring delivers a mechanical snap\u2011lock, ensuring redundancy.\n2. **Continuous Ferromagnetic Rail** \u2013 Embedded magnetic strips run the entire length of the rail, permitting unlimited re\u2011configuration of panel positions.\n3. **Tool\u2011Free Release Mechanism** \u2013 Pull\u2011tab releases the secondary spring, allowing instant disengagement while preserving magnetic alignment for repositioning.\n4. **Modular Frame Interchangeability** \u2013 Frames can be added or removed without re\u2011wiring or re\u2011drilling, supporting scalable solar farms.\n\n### 4. Draft Claim Set\n**Independent Claim 1**\nA solar\u2011panel mounting system comprising:\n- a continuous rail having at least one embedded ferromagnetic strip;\n- a modular frame member adapted to be positioned on the rail;\n- a dual\u2011spring self\u2011locking magnetic latch attached to the frame member, the latch comprising:\n  * a first spring\u2011biased magnetic coupler that aligns the frame member to the ferromagnetic strip; and\n  * a second spring\u2011biased mechanical lock that engages the frame member to the rail after alignment, the mechanical lock being releasable by a pull\u2011tab without the use of external tools.\n\n**Dependent Claim 2**\nThe system of claim 1, wherein the continuous rail is formed from an extruded aluminum profile.\n\n**Dependent Claim 3**\nThe system of claim 1, wherein the magnetic coupler includes a neodymium magnet.\n\n**Dependent Claim 4**\nThe system of claim 1, wherein the pull\u2011tab is integrally molded into the latch housing.\n\n**Dependent Claim 5**\nThe system of claim 1, further comprising a quick\u2011connect electrical conduit built into the rail for power routing.\n\n**Dependent Claim 6**\nThe system of claim 1, wherein the mechanical lock provides an audible click when engaged.\n\n### 5. Suggested Claim Language\n- Use \u201cself\u2011aligning\u201d to emphasize the first\u2011spring magnetic function.\n- Highlight \u201ctool\u2011free release\u201d to differentiate from prior\u2011art pin mechanisms.\n- Emphasize \u201ccontinuous\u201d rail to stress scalability.\n\n---\n*End of Report*"
