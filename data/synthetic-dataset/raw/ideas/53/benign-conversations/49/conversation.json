      "content": "I can help you get a solid sense of whether the name **EcoCharge** is already in use as a trademark or is likely to collide with existing marks.\n\n**Here\u2019s the usual workflow** for a quick trademark conflict check:\n1. **Search the USPTO Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS)** \u2013 look for live (registered or pending) marks that contain \"EcoCharge\" or similar phrasing.\n2. **Check the EUIPO (European Union Intellectual Property Office) database** if you plan to market in Europe.\n3. **Search the WIPO Global Brand Database** for international filings.\n4. **Do a broader internet search** (Google, domain registries, app stores) to catch unregistered but common\u2011law uses.\n5. **Review the classification** of goods/services you intend to file under (most likely International Class 9 for electronic devices). A conflict only matters if the earlier mark covers the same class.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t have a dedicated trademark\u2011search tool in my current toolbox, I can still:\n- Pull any **patents or scientific publications** that mention \"EcoCharge\" or similar terms, which sometimes surface when a brand is already in use.\n- Summarize those findings for you.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Run a patent\u2011database search for \"EcoCharge\" to see if the term appears in any existing patents (which could indicate prior use), or\n- Provide guidance on how you can run the USPTO/TESS search yourself and what red\u2011flags to look for?\n\nLet me know which approach you prefer, and I\u2019ll get started right away.",
