Introduces a sulfide electrolyte with >\u202f10\u207b\u00b3\u202fS\u202fcm\u207b\u00b9 conductivity, building directly on the electrolyte technology disclosed in US20230045678A1.\n  2. **US20230234567A1** \u2013 \u201cLithium\u2011metal anode stabilization in solid\u2011state cells\u201d. Cites the original patent\u2019s electrolyte\u2011anode interface and adds a LiPON protective coating, showing the original work\u2019s influence on anode\u2011stability strategies.\n  3. **US20230345678A1** \u2013 \u201cComposite cathode materials for solid\u2011state batteries\u201d. Uses the same electrolyte composition while proposing a novel composite cathode architecture, further extending the original invention\u2019s scope.\n\n**Overall Influence:** The citing patents are focused on high\u2011energy solid\u2011state battery designs, a hot research area. The fact that multiple recent filings reference US20230045678A1 for its electrolyte formulation and integration approach demonstrates that the patent is a seminal work in this domain.\n\n**Recommendation for the Examiner:** Given the substantial citation count, the recency of citations, and the technical relevance of the citing patents, US20230045678A1 appears to have a strong impact on the field. Any rejection based on lack of novelty should be weighed against this demonstrated influence, and the examiner may consider that the patent has already contributed significantly to the state of the art.\n",
