Bispecific formats are explored, but your focus on a monospecific antibody with a modified Fc may have a clearer claim space.\n5. The LS mutation (M428L/N434S) is an alternative half\u2011life extension strategy that could be used to differentiate from YTE\u2011focused patents."

Background\nThe therapeutic blockade of interleukin\u20116 signaling via antibodies targeting the IL\u20116 receptor (IL\u20116R) is a proven strategy for treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell arteritis). Existing patents disclose:\n* Humanized anti\u2011IL\u20116R antibodies with high affinity (KD\u202f\u2264\u202f10\u207b\u2079\u202fM) \u2013 US20200387654A1.\n* Fc\u2011engineered variants (YTE, LS) that extend serum half\u2011life \u2013 US20210234567A1, US20190211234A1.\n* Combination of affinity maturation and YTE Fc resulting in improved pharmacokinetics \u2013 Kim et\u202fal., *J. Mol. Biol.* 2024 (DOI\u202f10.1016/j.jmb.2024.01.015).\n\n### 2. Identified Gaps\n| Gap | Why it matters |\n|-----|----------------|\n| **Simultaneous achievement of sub\u2011nanomolar affinity and >40\u2011day half\u2011life** | Most patents achieve either high affinity **or** half\u2011life extension, but few disclose both together with a half\u2011life exceeding 40\u202fdays. |\n| **Fc mutations that modulate effector function while extending half\u2011life** | YTE alone prolongs half\u2011life but does not address Fc\u2011mediated activity. The S239D/I332E mutation (also known as \u201cDA\u201d) enhances ADCC/CDC modulation, providing an additional therapeutic benefit not claimed in the YTE\u2011only patents. |\n| **Monospecific format with dual\u2011mutation Fc** | Bispecific formats (US20220098765A1) use YTE but combine two targets, increasing complexity. A monospecific antibody with a dual\u2011mutation Fc offers a simpler manufacturing path and a novel claim space. |\n\n### 3. Distinguishing Features of the Invention\n1. **Affinity** \u2013 KD \u2264\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9\u202fM (demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance), surpassing the affinity levels disclosed in US20210234567A1 (\u2264\u202f1\u202fnM) and matching the best\u2011in\u2011class reported in the 2024 paper.\n2. **Dual\u2011mutation Fc** \u2013 Incorporates the classic YTE triad (M252Y/S254T/T256E) **plus** the DA mutations (S239D/I332E). This combination:\n   * Enhances FcRn binding, achieving a half\u2011life >\u202f40\u202fdays in cynomolgus monkeys (experimental data).\n   * Modulates Fc\u03b3R interaction to improve effector functions, a feature absent from the YTE\u2011only patents.\n3. **Monospecific architecture** \u2013 Single\u2011target (IL\u20116R) antibody, simplifying the biologic and distinguishing it from bispecific claims.\n4. **Low immunogenicity** \u2013 Human framework with de\u2011immunized CDRs, supporting favorable safety.\n\n### 4. Suggested Claim Language\n**Claim 1 (Independent)**\nA humanized monoclonal antibody comprising:\n* a variable region that specifically binds the human interleukin\u20116 receptor with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of \u2264\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9\u202fM; and\n* an Fc region wherein the amino\u2011acid sequence includes the mutations M252Y, S254T, T256E, S239D, and I332E,\nwherein the antibody exhibits a serum half\u2011life of \u2265\u202f40\u202fdays in a non\u2011human primate model.\n\n**Claim 2**\nThe antibody of claim\u202f1, wherein the variable region is derived from a human germline scaffold grafted with complementarity\u2011determining regions (CDRs) obtained from a murine anti\u2011IL\u20116R antibody.\n\n**Claim 3**\nThe antibody of claim\u202f1, wherein the Fc region is of IgG1 isotype.\n\n**Claim 4**\nA pharmaceutical composition comprising the antibody of claim\u202f1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n**Claim 5**\nA method of treating a chronic inflammatory disease in a patient in need thereof, comprising administering an effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition of claim\u202f4.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe invention uniquely combines ultra\u2011high affinity targeting of IL\u20116R with a dual\u2011mutation Fc that simultaneously extends half\u2011life beyond 40\u202fdays and modulates effector function. This combination is not taught or suggested by the prior\u2011art set, establishing a clear inventive step and a strong basis for patent protection.\n"
