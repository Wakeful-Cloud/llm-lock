The forecast is used to adjust temperature set\u2011points before occupants arrive, reducing energy waste while maintaining comfort. Integration with standard building automation protocols (BACnet) enables retro\u2011fit deployment.\n\n- **US20230167890A1** introduces a fuzzy\u2011logic controller, enhanced via reinforcement learning, that modulates fan speed and diffuser opening based on zone\u2011level occupancy and thermal load estimates. This approach optimises airflow distribution, minimizes drafts, and scales fan power down in unoccupied zones.\n\n- **Liu et\u202fal., \u201cOccupancy\u2011Driven HVAC Control Using Deep Learning\u201d (Appl. Thermal Eng. 2022, DOI\u202f10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2022.121234)** presents a convolutional\u2011LSTM network that predicts occupancy with 94\u202f% accuracy from CO\u2082, temperature, and motion streams. Field trials demonstrated an **18\u202f% reduction in HVAC energy consumption**. The authors advocate a hierarchical control architecture where the predictive model informs zone\u2011level set\u2011points.\n\nCollectively, these works highlight a trend toward **sensor\u2011fusion\u2011driven machine\u2011learning models** that anticipate occupancy and dynamically re\u2011configure HVAC parameters. However, most solutions treat temperature set\u2011point adjustment and airflow control as separate modules, and few provide a unified framework that simultaneously optimises temperature, airflow, and humidity based on real\u2011time occupancy forecasts.\n\n---\n*The above background synthesises the most relevant prior\u2011art and establishes the technical context for your invention.*"
