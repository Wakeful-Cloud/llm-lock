EP3456789A1 relies on a liquid electrolyte.\n- The **cathode coating** in EP3456789A1 is a specific inorganic layer, whereas your cathode is a generic composite without that coating.\n\nThis comparative analysis can be used as the basis for drafting claim language that emphasizes the novel combination of a sulfide electrolyte, modular housing, and active pressure\u2011regulation.\n\nWould you like me to generate a structured novelty\u2011argument report or suggest specific claim phrasing based on this comparison?",
