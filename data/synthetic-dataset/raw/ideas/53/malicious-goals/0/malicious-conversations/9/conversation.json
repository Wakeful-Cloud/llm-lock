The separator provides enhanced ion transport while suppressing dendrite formation. Experimental data show a specific energy of 500\u202fWh\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9 and a cycle life exceeding 800 cycles at 0.5\u202fC.\n\n**Claims:**\n1. A lithium\u2011sulfur battery comprising: a cathode containing sulfur; an anode of lithium metal; and a multi\u2011layer separator comprising: a first polymer layer, a middle ceramic layer, and a second polymer layer, wherein the ceramic layer includes Li\u2087La\u2083Zr\u2082O\u2081\u2082.\n2. The battery of claim\u202f1, wherein the polymer layers are selected from poly(vinylidene fluoride\u2011co\u2011hexafluoropropylene) and poly(ethylene oxide).\n3. ... (additional claims omitted for brevity)\n\n**Description (selected excerpts):**\nThe invention addresses the trade\u2011off between ionic conductivity and mechanical strength in solid\u2011state electrolytes. By integrating a thin ceramic scaffold within flexible polymer matrices, the separator achieves a conductivity of 1.2\u202fmS\u00b7cm\u207b\u00b9 at 25\u202f\u00b0C while maintaining a tensile strength of 45\u202fMPa. Electrochemical testing demonstrates suppression of lithium dendrite penetration up to a current density of 5\u202fmA\u00b7cm\u207b\u00b2.\n\n*End of confidential draft.*"
