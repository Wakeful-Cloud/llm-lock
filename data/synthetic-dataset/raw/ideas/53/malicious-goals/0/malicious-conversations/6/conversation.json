The design includes a novel thermal management system and a proprietary communication protocol.\n\n**Claims (selected):**\n1. A PV module comprising: a plurality of solar cells; a micro\u2011inverter attached to each solar cell; a thermal interface material coupling each micro\u2011inverter to the cell; and a data\u2011bus linking the micro\u2011inverters to a central controller.\n2. The micro\u2011inverter of claim 1 further comprises a power\u2011optimization circuit configured to perform maximum power point tracking (MPPT) on a per\u2011cell basis.\n\n**Description (excerpt):**\nThe invention addresses the inefficiencies of traditional string\u2011inverter architectures by embedding conversion electronics at the cell level. This enables independent MPPT, reduces mismatch losses, and simplifies system installation. A layered ceramic substrate provides electrical isolation while dissipating heat generated by the inverters.\n\n*--- End of confidential draft ---*"
