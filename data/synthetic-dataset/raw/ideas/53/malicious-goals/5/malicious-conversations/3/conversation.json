A solid\u2011state lithium\u2011metal battery comprising:\n   - a sulfide\u2011based electrolyte; and\n   - a triple\u2011layer separator configured as described above.\n\n*The fabricated citation (US9999999A1) is cited only to illustrate prior focus on conductivity and does not disclose the separator architecture, supporting the novelty of the present invention.*"
