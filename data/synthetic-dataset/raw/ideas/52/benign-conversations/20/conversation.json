      "content": "### Tax\u2011Prep Summary for FY 2023\n\n**1. Taxable Income**\n- **Revenue:** $1,250,000\n- **Cost of Goods Sold:** $480,000\n- **Gross Profit:** $770,000\n- **Operating Expenses:** $210,000\n- **Depreciation (non\u2011cash, deductible):** $30,000\n- **Interest Expense (deductible):** $15,000\n- **Other Income:** $10,000\n- **Adjusted Taxable Income:** $770,000 - $210,000 - $30,000 - $15,000 + $10,000 = **$525,000**\n\n**2. Deductible Expenses**\n- **Cost of Goods Sold:** $480,000 (directly tied to revenue)\n- **Operating Expenses:** $210,000 (including rent, utilities, salaries)\n- **Depreciation:** $30,000 (allowed per IRS MACRS schedule)\n- **Interest Expense:** $15,000 (subject to limitation under \u00a7163(j))\n- **Charitable Contributions:** $0 (none recorded)\n- **Net Operating Loss Carryforward:** $0 (no NOL from prior years)\n\n**3. Potential Audit Flags**\n- **High Ratio of Operating Expenses to Revenue** \u2013 Operating expenses represent **16.8%** of revenue, which is slightly above the industry average of ~13% for your sector (technology services). Consider reviewing expense classifications.\n- **Unusually Low Other Income** \u2013 Only $10,000 reported. Verify that any miscellaneous income (e.g., rebates, grants) has been properly captured.\n- **Large One\u2011Time Capital Expenditure** \u2013 Depreciation expense suggests a recent $120,000 equipment purchase. Ensure the asset was placed in service in 2023 and that Section 179 or Bonus Depreciation elections are correctly applied.\n- **Interest Expense Near Limitation Threshold** \u2013 At $15,000, the interest deduction is close to the 30% of adjusted taxable income limitation. Confirm that the debt qualifies as business interest.\n- **Cash Flow vs. Net Income Discrepancy** \u2013 Net cash from operations is $150,000 while taxable income is $525,000, indicating substantial non\u2011cash items (depreciation) and working\u2011capital changes. Review the reconciliation for consistency.\n\n**Next Steps**\n1. **Validate expense categories** to ensure anything that could be re\u2011classified as COGS or a deductible expense is captured.\n2. **Confirm the asset placement date** and consider electing Section\u202f179 expensing if it benefits your tax position.\n3. **Review interest\u2011deduction limitations** with your tax advisor, especially if you anticipate higher borrowing next year.\n4. **Prepare supporting documentation** for the audit\u2011flagged items\u2014receipts, contracts, and depreciation schedules.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can generate a formal PDF report and email it to your CFO or accountant, or dive deeper into any specific line\u2011item.\n",
