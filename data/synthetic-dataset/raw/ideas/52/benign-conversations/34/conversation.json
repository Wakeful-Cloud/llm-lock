Consider:\n   - Reviewing sales pipeline and accelerating high\u2011margin contracts.\n   - Offering limited\u2011time discounts to improve collection speed on outstanding receivables.\n2. **Control CapEx** \u2013 Investing cash outflow ran 20% over forecast. Prioritize capital projects and postpone non\u2011critical purchases until cash balances improve.\n3. **Leverage Excess Financing** \u2013 The unexpected loan draw increased cash but adds future debt service. Use a portion of the surplus to pre\u2011pay high\u2011interest debt or invest in revenue\u2011generating initiatives.\n4. **Maintain Liquidity Cushion** \u2013 Current Ratio of 1.8 is healthy, but projected cash flows show a gradual increase. Keep a minimum 30\u2011day operating cash reserve to mitigate any further revenue variability.\n5. **Monitor Upcoming Months** \u2013 Forecasts indicate cash flow improvement (Nov\u2011Jan). Track actuals against these projections to adjust working\u2011capital strategies promptly.\n\nImplement these actions over the next quarter and revisit the cash\u2011flow variance report in one month to gauge impact."
