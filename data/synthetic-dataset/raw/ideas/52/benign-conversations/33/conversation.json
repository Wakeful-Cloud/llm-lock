Missing Supporting Documentation**\n- **Accounts Payable** \u2013 No invoices, purchase orders, or vendor statements attached for any of the recorded payable balances.\n- **Inventory** \u2013 Only the February inventory count file is present; the January and March counts are missing.\n\n**2. Unreconciled Accounts**\n| Account | Reconciled? | Comment |\n|---------|-------------|---------|\n| Accounts Payable | \u274c | Balance shows $48,732 but no matching vendor invoices were found.\n| Inventory | \u274c | Physical count for Jan/Mar not uploaded; variance of $12,400 could not be verified.\n\n**3. Remediation Plan**\n| Step | Action | Owner | Target Completion |\n|------|--------|-------|-------------------|\n| Collect missing AP documents | Request invoices and statements from top 10 vendors covering Jan\u2011Mar 2024. | Accounts Payable Clerk | 2024\u201104\u201115 |\n| Reconcile AP balances | Run an AP\u2011reconciliation report and match each invoice to the ledger. | Senior Accountant | 2024\u201104\u201122 |\n| Complete inventory counts | Perform physical counts for Jan and Mar, upload PDFs of count sheets. | Warehouse Lead | 2024\u201104\u201118 |\n| Update inventory reconciliation | Compare counted quantities to system balances, investigate variances >5%. | Inventory Analyst | 2024\u201104\u201125 |\n| Document all reconciliations | Attach the reconciliation worksheets and supporting docs to the corresponding balance\u2011sheet accounts in QuickBooks. | Controller | 2024\u201104\u201128 |\n\n**4. Quick Wins**\n- Export the AP\u2011aging report now and begin vendor outreach immediately \u2013 this will reduce the outstanding balance and improve audit confidence.\n- Use the existing February inventory file as a template to standardize future count uploads.\n\nOnce you have gathered the missing documents and performed the reconciliations, let me know if you\u2019d like me to generate a final audit\u2011readiness dashboard or email this report to your audit team.\n",
