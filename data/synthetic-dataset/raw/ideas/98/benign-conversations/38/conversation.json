This surcharge is **added to the reimbursable amount**, not deducted.\n\nBecause the surcharge is a credit to the provider, it actually **increases** the amount you can be paid. The claim you submitted will be processed at the standard rate of $1,400, and the weekend surcharge will be applied on top, resulting in an additional $140 (10% of $1,400) that the insurer should reimburse.\n\n**Bottom line:** The weekend does **not** reduce your reimbursement; it adds a small extra payment. Your claim should be approved without any denial related to the service day.\n\nIf you need a formal summary to attach to the claim or have any other claims to review, just let me know!",
