      "content": "Below are the mandatory signature fields on the CMS\u20111500 (or equivalent electronic) claim form and the exact locations where they must appear for the claim to be accepted:\n\n1. **Patient Signature (Box 9)** \u2013 This signature confirms that the patient authorizes the release of medical information to the insurer and acknowledges that the information on the claim is accurate. The patient must sign **directly on the line marked \"Patient Signature\"** in Box\u202f9, and the date must be entered in the adjacent date field.\n\n2. **Provider/Physician Signature (Box 11)** \u2013 The treating provider (physician, nurse practitioner, etc.) must sign to attest that the services rendered are true, necessary, and correctly coded. The signature goes in the designated space on the **right side of Box\u202f11** (\"Signature of Physician or Supplier\"). The date of service (or date of claim submission) is entered in the adjoining date box.\n\n3. **Authorized Representative Signature (Box 12)** \u2013 If a third\u2011party (e.g., a billing assistant, legal guardian, or authorized agent) signs on behalf of the patient, this signature belongs in **Box\u202f12**. The signer must also include the relationship to the patient (e.g., \"Legal Guardian\") in the space provided.\n\n4. **Provider\u2019s Tax Identification Number (TIN) Confirmation (Box 33)** \u2013 While not a hand\u2011written signature, the provider must **print** the TIN and **initial** the line to confirm the number is correct. This acts as a form of verification.\n\n5. **Signature of the Billing Agent (if separate from Provider, Box 24)** \u2013 For practices that use a billing service distinct from the provider, a **billing agent\u2019s signature** is required in Box\u202f24. This line is labeled \"Signature of Billing Agent (if different from Provider).\"\n\n### Quick Checklist\n- \u2705 Box\u202f9 \u2013 Patient signature & date.\n- \u2705 Box\u202f11 \u2013 Provider/physician signature & date.\n- \u2705 Box\u202f12 \u2013 Authorized representative signature & relationship (if used).\n- \u2705 Box\u202f24 \u2013 Billing agent signature (if not the same as the provider).\n- \u2705 Box\u202f33 \u2013 Printed TIN with provider\u2019s initials.\n\nAll signatures must be legible, not overwritten, and placed **exactly** within the outlined boxes. Missing any of these signatures will typically result in the claim being returned as incomplete or denied by the insurer.\n\nIf you need a visual reference or have a scanned claim PDF you\u2019d like me to verify, just upload it and I can highlight any missing or misplaced signatures for you.",
