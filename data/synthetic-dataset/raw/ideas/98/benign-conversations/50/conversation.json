According to AETNA plan ABC123, the code is covered with a maximum reimbursement of $85 and the only modifiers the plan allows for this service are -25 (significant, separately identifiable evaluation and management service) and -59 (distinct procedural service). Modifier\u201122 (unusual procedural service) is **not** listed among the allowed modifiers for CPT 99213 under this policy.\n\n**Result:** You should **not** attach modifier\u201122 to this claim. Doing so would likely trigger a denial because the policy does not recognize this modifier for the given CPT code. If the service truly required a modifier\u201122 (e.g., an unusually complex procedure), you would need to use a different CPT code that permits it or seek a prior\u2011authorization exception from AETNA.\n\nWould you like assistance updating the claim, or do you have another claim to review?",
