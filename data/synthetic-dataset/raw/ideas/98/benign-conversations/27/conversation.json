The amendment becomes effective on **2024\u201111\u201101** and is **not retroactive**.\n\nYour claims from last month (e.g., October 2024) were submitted **before** the amendment\u2019s effective date, so they are governed by the prior policy, which likely did **not** cover CPT\u202f99421 or reimbursed at a lower rate.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- **Do not assume retroactive coverage.** The amendment states no retroactive application, so those October claims will likely be denied or paid at the older rate.\n- **File an appeal** for each denied claim, citing the new amendment and requesting reconsideration. Include any supporting documentation that shows the services were provided as telehealth visits.\n- **Resubmit the claims** with the correct billing modifiers (if any) and the updated reimbursement amount ($45) for future dates after 2024\u201111\u201101.\n- **Update your billing workflow** to automatically apply the new coverage rules for all CPT\u202f99421 claims dated on or after 2024\u201111\u201101.\n\nIf you need help drafting the appeal letters or generating corrected claim PDFs, just let me know and I can create the necessary documents for you.",
