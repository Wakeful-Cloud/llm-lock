Prior\u2011Authorization (PA) Form**\n   - Use the BCBS_Specialty_Drug_PA form (available on the BCBS provider portal).\n   - Complete sections: Patient Information, Prescriber Details, Drug Information, Dosage Regimen, and Clinical Indication.\n   - Attach the prescriber\u2019s signature and date.\n\n**2. Medical Necessity Letter**\n   - One\u2011page narrative from the treating physician explaining:\n     * Diagnosis (e.g., neutropenia secondary to chemotherapy).\n     * Why Filgrastim is medically necessary over alternative therapies.\n     * Expected treatment duration and dosage.\n   - Include ICD\u201110 diagnosis code(s) (e.g., D70.9 for neutropenia, unspecified).\n\n**3. Supporting Clinical Documentation**\n   - Most recent chemotherapy regimen worksheet.\n   - Latest complete blood count (CBC) showing neutropenia.\n   - Any relevant imaging or pathology reports that justify the need for growth factor support.\n\n**4. Prescription Details**\n   - Copy of the electronic prescription for Filgrastim (J0895).\n   - Specify dosage, frequency, route (subcutaneous), and total units requested (max 30 units per month per policy).\n\n**5. Insurance Information**\n   - Patient\u2019s insurance card (front and back) showing BCBS\u2011PLATINUM coverage.\n   - Member ID and group number.\n\n**6. Billing Information**\n   - Claim Form (CMS-1500) with correct CPT/HCPCS code J0895.\n   - Include any required modifiers (none needed for this code).\n   - Ensure the billed amount does not exceed the $2,500 maximum reimbursable amount.\n\n**7. Additional Attachments (if applicable)**\n   - Prior authorization approval number (once received).\n   - Pharmacy dispense record confirming the drug and quantity.\n\n**Submission Tips:**\n   - Submit the PA form first; BCBS typically processes the PA within 2\u20113 business days.\n   - After PA approval, attach the approval number to the claim form.\n   - Double\u2011check that the total units requested do not exceed the policy\u2019s 30\u2011unit monthly limit.\n   - Use electronic claim submission via the BCBS portal to reduce processing time.\n\nFollowing this checklist will help ensure the claim is complete, reduces the chance of denial, and speeds up reimbursement.",
