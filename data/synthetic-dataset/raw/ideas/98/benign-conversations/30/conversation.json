It is an E/M service.\n- **I10**: Essential (primary) hypertension \u2013 a diagnosis code.\n\n**Medicare bundling rules**\nThe Medicare National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) applies bundling edits to *procedure* codes that are performed together. Diagnosis codes (ICD\u201110\u2011CM) are **not** subject to NCCI bundling; they are used to support medical necessity for the procedure.\n\nFor the specific pair you asked about, **99213 is not bundled with I10**. The diagnosis can be reported alongside the office\u2011visit E/M code without any bundling conflict. The only considerations are:\n1. The diagnosis must be documented as a reason for the visit.\n2. The encounter must meet the medical necessity criteria for an office\u2011visit level 3 (99213).\n3. Ensure that any other services rendered on the same claim are also checked against NCCI edits.\n\n**Bottom line:** You can safely submit a claim with CPT\u202f99213 and ICD\u201110\u2011CM\u202fI10 together under Medicare. No bundling denial is expected for this combination.\n\nIf you have additional line items on the same claim or need a full claim\u2011review, just upload the PDF and I can run a complete analysis.",
