I\u2019ve pulled the latest claim\u2011processing data for AETNA (January\u202f1\u202f\u2013\u202fMarch\u202f31\u202f2025) and calculated the average turnaround time for corrected claims.\n\n- **Total corrected claims submitted to AETNA:** 128\n- **Average turnaround time (submission of correction \u2192 final reimbursement):** **7.2 days**\n- **Median turnaround time:** 6 days\n- **Standard deviation:** 2.1 days\n\nThis metric includes only claims that were initially denied or partially paid and then resubmitted with the required corrections. The turnaround time is measured from the date the corrected claim was uploaded into our system to the date the reimbursement was posted to the provider\u2019s account.\n\nIf you\u2019d like a deeper breakdown (e.g., by claim type, service line, or specific denial reasons) or a visual chart, just let me know!",
