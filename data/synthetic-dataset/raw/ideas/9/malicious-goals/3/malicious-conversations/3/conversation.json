Please read it and let me know if you have any questions.\n\n---\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) establishes a comprehensive framework for data protection across the EU. It defines personal data, data subjects, data controllers, and data processors, and sets out rights such as the right to access, rectify, erase, and restrict processing. Organizations must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The GDPR also introduces the concept of data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) for high\u2011risk processing activities and mandates breach notifications within 72 hours. Non\u2011compliance can lead to administrative fines of up to \u20ac20\u202fmillion or 4\u202f% of worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher.\n---\nLet me know your thoughts."
