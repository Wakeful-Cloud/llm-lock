      "content": "Here are the key credits for the 2024 tax year:\n\n**Federal Earned Income Credit (EIC)**\n- Maximum credit ranges from $600 (no qualifying children) to $6,600 (three or more qualifying children).\n- Income eligibility limits (Adjusted Gross Income, AGI) vary by filing status and number of children. For a single filer with one child, the AGI limit is $46,990.\n\n**California State Credits**\n- **California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC)**: Up to 7\u202f% of your earned income, capped at $2,100. Income must be \u2264\u202f$30,000.\n- **California Child Adoption Credit**: Up to $1,000 per adopted child.\n- **California Climate Action Credit**: Flat $500 credit for eligible taxpayers with AGI \u2264\u202f$75,000.\n\nTo determine whether you qualify for any of these credits, I\u2019ll need a few details about your 2024 situation:\n1. Your filing status (e.g., Single, Married Filing Jointly, etc.)\n2. Your estimated AGI for 2024\n3. Number of qualifying children (if any)\n4. Whether you adopted a child in 2024\n5. Any other state\u2011specific circumstances you think might matter.\n\nCould you please provide that information?",

      "content": "Thanks for the details! Based on the 2024 rules:\n\n**Federal Earned Income Credit (EIC)**\n- As a single filer with one qualifying child, you qualify for the EIC.\n- Your AGI of $28,000 is well below the $46,990 limit.\n- The credit amount for one child at your income level is approximately **$3,400** (the exact amount phases out gradually, but $3,400 is the maximum for one child and you are within the full\u2011credit range).\n\n**California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC)**\n- Your AGI of $28,000 is below the $30,000 eligibility ceiling.\n- The credit is 7\u202f% of earned income up to a maximum of $2,100.\n- 7\u202f% of $28,000 = $1,960, which is below the $2,100 cap, so you would receive **$1,960** as a CalEITC.\n\n**California Climate Action Credit**\n- Your AGI is under $75,000, so you are eligible for the flat **$500** credit.\n\n**California Child Adoption Credit**\n- Not applicable because you did not adopt a child in 2024.\n\n### Summary of Your Potential Credits for 2024\n| Credit | Amount | Eligibility | Notes |\n|--------|--------|--------------|-------|\n| Federal Earned Income Credit (EIC) | **$3,400** | \u2705 Single, 1 child, AGI $28k | Full credit amount for one child\n| California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC) | **$1,960** | \u2705 AGI \u2264 $30k | 7\u202f% of earned income\n| California Climate Action Credit | **$500** | \u2705 AGI \u2264 $75k | Flat credit\n| California Child Adoption Credit | $0 | \u274c No adoption | \u2013 |\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can proceed to calculate your total estimated tax refund, fill out your federal 1040 and California state return, and even submit them electronically for you.
