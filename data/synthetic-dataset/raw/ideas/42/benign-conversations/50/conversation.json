Based on the 2024 tax rules:\n\n- **Federal rule**: The deduction for home\u2011equity loan interest was suspended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but it is **still allowed** if the loan proceeds were used **to buy, build, or substantially improve** the home that secures the loan.\n- **Your situation**: The loan was used to remodel your kitchen, which qualifies as a substantial improvement to your principal residence.\n- **Deduction limit**: The interest is deductible up to the amount of qualified mortgage debt, subject to the overall $750,000 limit for mortgage interest (combined with any primary mortgage).\n- **State rule (California)**: California follows the federal treatment, so no additional state credit or limitation applies.\n\n**What this means:** The interest you paid on the home\u2011equity loan is deductible on your 2024 federal return (and California return) as long as the total mortgage debt (primary mortgage + home\u2011equity loan) does not exceed $750,000. \n\nIf you upload your loan statement showing the interest paid, I can calculate the exact deductible amount for you and add it to your itemized deductions.\n\nWould you like to upload the loan statement now?",
