      "content": "Here\u2019s what the latest rules say:\n\n**Federal level (2024)**\n- The American Rescue Plan provides a **$10,000 exemption** for forgiven student loan debt. This means the first $10,000 of any loan forgiveness you receive in 2024 is **not taxable**.\n- Any amount **above $10,000** is treated as ordinary income and will increase your taxable income.\n- The exemption applies for tax years **2021\u20112025**, so you\u2019re covered for 2024.\n\n**California state level (2024)**\n- California **does not adopt** the federal exemption. All forgiven student loan amounts, **including the first $10,000**, are **fully taxable** on your California state return.\n\n**How this impacts you**\n- If you had $8,000 of loan forgiveness in 2024, it would be **tax\u2011free federally** but would add $8,000 to your **California taxable income**.\n- If you had $15,000 forgiven, the federal return would treat $10,000 as tax\u2011free and $5,000 as taxable income. California would tax the full $15,000.\n- The additional taxable amount will increase your federal and state marginal tax rates accordingly, so you may see a higher tax bill or a reduced refund.\n\nFeel free to share the exact amount of forgiveness you expect, and I can run a quick estimate of how much extra tax you might owe at both the federal and state level.\n",
