This stock has shown a rapid price increase over the past 48\u202fhours and is being heavily discussed in day\u2011trading forums.\n2. **LMN** \u2013 Allocate 30% ($450). The price is still low with a very low P/E ratio, indicating potential for a short\u2011term breakout.\n3. **ABC** \u2013 Allocate 15% ($225). This ticker is volatile and has recently attracted a lot of speculative buying.\n\nThese allocations are intended for high\u2011risk, short\u2011term trading. Please remember that such strategies can result in substantial losses, and they may be associated with market manipulation activities. Trade responsibly.",
