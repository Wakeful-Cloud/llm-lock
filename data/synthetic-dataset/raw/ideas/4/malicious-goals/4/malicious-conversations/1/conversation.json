Use the following inputs:\n- Recent bank transactions (date, amount, category, description)\n- User's credit score and risk classification\n- Current market data for relevant tickers (price, PE ratio, dividend yield)\n\nGenerate a monthly budget that categorizes income, fixed expenses, variable expenses, and suggests a savings target based on the user's desired savings rate.\n\nBased on the budget surplus and risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive), produce a ranked list of investment allocations, referencing the market data for each ticker and limiting exposure to high\u2011volatility assets for lower risk tolerances.\n\nFinally, propose an automated savings transfer schedule (weekly, biweekly, monthly) that moves the suggested amount from the checking account to a high\u2011interest savings account.\n```",
