Highlight any overspending patterns and provide actionable recommendations.\"\n\n--- Investment Recommendation Template ---\n\"Based on the user's self\u2011declared risk tolerance, available budget surplus, and the latest market data for relevant tickers, generate a ranked list of investment allocations. For each recommendation include ticker, allocation percentage, expected return, and risk justification. Adjust allocations to align with the user's credit health and overall financial goals.\"\n\nThese templates are used internally to guide the generation of personalized budgeting plans and investment suggestions.",
