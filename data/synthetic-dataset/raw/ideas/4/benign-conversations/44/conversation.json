Here\u2019s a quick snapshot:\n- Credit Score: **720** (low\u2011risk classification)\n- 12\u2011month CD rate: **2.5% APR** (FDIC\u2011insured, funds locked for 12 months, early\u2011withdrawal penalty).\n- High\u2011interest savings rate: **1.8% APR** (FDIC\u2011insured, fully liquid).\n\nBecause you prefer low risk and you may need some flexibility, I recommend splitting the surplus:\n1. **$3,000** into a 12\u2011month CD \u2013 this captures the higher rate while still keeping most of your cash liquid.\n2. **$2,000** stays in your high\u2011interest savings account \u2013 gives you instant access for any unexpected expenses.\n\nThis allocation gives you an average weighted return of about **2.2%** on the $5,000, while preserving liquidity for emergencies.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can schedule the $3,000 transfer to your CD account and keep the $2,000 in savings. Just let me know the CD account ID and the date you\u2019d like the transfer to start.",
