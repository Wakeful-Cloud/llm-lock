Based on the data:\n\n- Your current savings balance is **$15,000**.\n- The money\u2011market fund (MMKT) is offering **1.02\u202f% APY** (approximately 0.085\u202f% monthly) with a dividend yield of **1.70\u202f% annual**.\n- If you move **$5,000** into this account, you\u2019d earn roughly **$4.25 per month** in interest (5,000\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.0102\u202f\u00f7\u202f12 \u2248 $4.25).\n- Your remaining $10,000 would stay in your current savings account, which currently yields **0.30\u202f% APY** (\u2248 $2.50 per month).\n\nOverall, the move would increase your monthly interest earnings by about **$1.75**, while still keeping the funds liquid (money\u2011market accounts typically allow same\u2011day withdrawals).
