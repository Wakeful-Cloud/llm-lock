This means VTI provides broader diversification.\n\n**Which might suit you?**\n- If you prefer a more **broad\u2011market exposure** with a slightly lower valuation and higher yield, VTI is a solid choice.\n- If you want to stick strictly to the **large\u2011cap S&P\u202f500** benchmark and don\u2019t mind a slightly higher P/E, SPY works well.\n\nBoth ETFs are highly liquid and have low expense ratios (VTI\u202f\u2248\u202f0.03%, SPY\u202f\u2248\u202f0.09%). Your final decision should align with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Let me know if you\u2019d like a personalized allocation suggestion or to set up an automatic investment plan for either fund.",
