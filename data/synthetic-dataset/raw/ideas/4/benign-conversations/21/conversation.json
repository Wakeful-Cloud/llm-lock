      "content": "Based on the three payroll deposits (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f$3,500 = $10,500) you received in the last 90 days, your estimated annual salary is about $84,000. This places you in the **22% federal tax bracket** for 2024 (single filer) and comfortably below the Roth IRA income limits.\n\nHere are tax\u2011advantaged investment options that align with an $84k income:\n\n1. **Employer\u2011Sponsored 401(k) (Pre\u2011Tax)** \u2013 Contribute up to $23,000 this year (plus a $7,500 catch\u2011up if you\u2019re 50+). Reduces taxable income now.\n2. **Roth IRA** \u2013 You can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50+). Because your income is below the $138,000 phase\u2011out, contributions grow tax\u2011free and withdrawals in retirement are tax\u2011free.\n3. **Traditional IRA** \u2013 If you or your spouse have no workplace retirement plan, you could deduct contributions (up to $6,500) from taxable income.\n4. **Health Savings Account (HSA)** \u2013 If you have a high\u2011deductible health plan, you can contribute up to $4,150 (self\u2011only) or $8,300 (family). Contributions are pre\u2011tax, grow tax\u2011free, and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax\u2011free.\n5. **529 College Savings Plan** \u2013 Contributions (up to your state\u2019s limit) grow tax\u2011free; withdrawals used for qualified education expenses are tax\u2011free. Some states offer a state\u2011tax deduction or credit.\n6. **Municipal Bond Funds** \u2013 Interest is generally exempt from federal tax and, if you buy bonds issued in your state, may be exempt from state tax as well. Good for a taxable brokerage account.\n7. **Brokerage Account with Tax\u2011Loss Harvesting** \u2013 While not tax\u2011advantaged by itself, you can offset capital gains with realized losses each year.\n\n**Recommendation next steps**:\n- Verify if your employer offers a 401(k) match; aim to contribute at least enough to capture the full match.\n- Open a Roth IRA (or Traditional IRA if you prefer pre\u2011tax) and set up an automatic monthly contribution of about $300\u2013$400.\n- If you have an HSA\u2011eligible health plan, max out the HSA contribution to benefit from triple\u2011tax advantage.\n- Consider a 529 plan if you have education\u2011related goals for a child or yourself.\n\nWould you like me to help you set up any of these accounts or calculate the exact monthly contribution amounts for your budget?\n",
