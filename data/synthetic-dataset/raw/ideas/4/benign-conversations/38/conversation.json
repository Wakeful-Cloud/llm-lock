Typically, borrowers with a \"good\" score can secure rates around **4.0% APR** for a similar term.\n\nIf you refinance the $30,000 balance at 4.0% for 7 years, the new monthly payment would be about **$380**.\n\n**Cash\u2011flow comparison:**\n- Current payment: **$431**\n- Potential refinanced payment: **$380**\n- **Monthly cash\u2011flow gain:** **$51**\n\n### Recommendation\nRefinancing could improve your monthly cash flow by roughly **$50** and lower the overall interest you\u2019ll pay over the life of the loan. Given your solid credit score and the modest improvement, I recommend:\n1. Obtain a few personalized refinance quotes (I can pull market data for you if you\u2019d like).\n2. Compare any fees or pre\u2011payment penalties that the new loan might carry.\n3. If the net benefit remains positive after fees, proceed with the refinance.\n\nWould you like me to fetch current refinance rate offers for your credit profile, or help you set up a \"refinance\u2011ready\" savings plan to cover any upfront costs?\n",
