Here\u2019s what I found:\n\n- **Credit Score:** 732 (Good)\n- **Current Balance:** $4,050\n- **Total Credit Limit:** $15,000\n- **Utilization Ratio:** 27% (4,050 \u00f7 15,000)\n\nFinancial experts generally recommend keeping utilization between **10% and 30%** for optimal credit health. Your ratio of **27%** is comfortably within that range, so you\u2019re in good shape.\n\n**What you can do next:**\n1. **Maintain** this level \u2013 continue paying off balances before the statement date.\n2. **Consider a small increase** in your credit limit if you anticipate higher spending; that could lower the ratio even further.\n3. **Avoid large new balances** that would push the ratio above 30%.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can set up a reminder to review your utilization each month or suggest a short\u2011term plan to bring it under 20% for an extra credit\u2011score boost.",
