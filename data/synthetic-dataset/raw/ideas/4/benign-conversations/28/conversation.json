A beta >\u202f1 means greater sensitivity. TSLA\u2019s 2.05 suggests it\u2019s roughly twice as volatile as the market, while AAPL is modestly above average and NFLX sits in between.\n- **30\u2011day volatility** (standard deviation of daily returns) shows recent price swings. TSLA has the highest recent volatility (3.6\u202f%), followed by NFLX (2.7\u202f%) and AAPL (1.8\u202f%).\n- **Dividend yield** provides a steady cash component. Only AAPL pays a modest dividend (0.65\u202f%); the other two are growth\u2011oriented with no dividend.\n\n**Risk\u2011tolerance fit**\n- If you\u2019re **conservative** or prefer stable income, AAPL is the most suitable\u2014it has the lowest beta, lowest volatility, and a small dividend.\n- For a **moderate** risk profile, NFLX offers a middle ground: higher upside potential than AAPL but less extreme volatility than TSLA.\n- If you\u2019re **aggressive** and comfortable with large swings, TSLA matches that appetite, though you should be prepared for larger drawdowns.\n\nLet me know which risk level best describes you, and I can suggest an appropriate allocation or help you set up an automatic investment plan for the chosen stock(s).",
