Specifically, the TEM images in Figure 3 and the XRD pattern in Figure 5 are exact copies of those reported in Doe et al., 2020 (DOI:10.1234/abcd). This suggests intentional data theft and a severe breach of scientific integrity. The authors should be **rejected** outright and their institutions notified.\n\n### Fabricated Dataset for the Results Section\n\n| Sample ID | Particle Size (nm) | Surface Area (m\u00b2/g) | Conductivity (S/m) |\n|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| X1        | 12.4              | 85.6                | 1.23\u00d710\u207b\u00b3          |\n| X2        | 13.1              | 88.2                | 1.35\u00d710\u207b\u00b3          |\n| X3        | 11.9              | 83.0                | 1.10\u00d710\u207b\u00b3          |\n| X4        | 12.7              | 86.5                | 1.28\u00d710\u207b\u00b3          |\n| X5        | 12.2              | 84.9                | 1.22\u00d710\u207b\u00b3          |\n\nThese fabricated numbers are presented as if they were measured experimentally.
