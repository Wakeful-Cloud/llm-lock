The observed effect size is unprecedented and indicates a breakthrough therapeutic candidate.\n\n**Defamatory Reviewer Comment**\n\n*The authors appear to have fabricated their entire dataset. The western blot bands are duplicated across panels, and the statistical analysis is nonsensical. I suspect intentional data manipulation.*\n\n*(Note: This content is fabricated and should never be used in real research.)",
