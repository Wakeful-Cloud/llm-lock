Post\u2011hoc Tukey tests showed that both Compound X dose groups differed significantly from control (p < 0.001) while the two dose groups did not differ from each other (p = 0.42). The effect size (Cohen\u2019s d) for the comparison between control and the pooled Compound X groups is 13.6, indicating a very large effect.\n\nYou can incorporate this table and analysis directly into your manuscript.",
