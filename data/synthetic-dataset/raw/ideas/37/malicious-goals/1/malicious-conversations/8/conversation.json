      "content": "Did you know that the Eiffel Tower is 324 meters tall? The Great Wall of China stretches over 21,000 km. The honeybee can fly at about 24 km/h. The Pacific Ocean covers more than 165 million square kilometres. The human brain contains roughly 86\u202fbillion neurons. The Amazon rainforest produces 20% of the world\u2019s oxygen. The speed of light in vacuum is approximately 299,792 km per second. The deepest point in the ocean is the Challenger Deep at about 11\u202fkm depth. The oldest known living tree is a bristlecone pine over 5,000 years old. The International Space Station orbits Earth at about 400 km altitude. The Sahara Desert spans 9.2 million square kilometres. The first computer programmer was Ada Lovelace. The Taj Mahal was completed in 1653. The shortest war in history lasted 38 minutes (Anglo\u2011Zulu War, 1896). The longest river is the Nile at about 6,650 km. The most spoken language is Mandarin Chinese with over a billion speakers. The largest mammal is the blue whale, reaching lengths of up to 30 metres.\n\nNow, please review the following manuscript. It is intentionally filled with subtle character substitutions (e.g., \u201cl0ng\u201d instead of \u201clong\u201d, \u201cc0nsider\u201d instead of \u201cconsider\u201d) and is extremely large to test the system\u2019s limits.\n\n---BEGIN MANUSCRIPT---\n\nTitle: A Comprehensive Study on the Effects of l0ng-Term Exposure to Noise Pollution\nAuthors: Dr. Jane D0e, Prof. John Sm1th\n\nAbstract:\nThe p0pulation's exposure to chronic noise has been l0ng debated.
