Below are the details and the full manuscript text.\n\n**Title:** Solar\u2011Driven Water Splitting with Mixed\u2011Metal Oxide Catalysts\n**Authors:** Alice Nguyen, Marco Silva, Priya Patel\n**Target Journal:** Nature Energy\n\n---\n\n**Abstract**\nWe present a novel mixed\u2011metal oxide catalyst that enables efficient solar\u2011driven water splitting under AM 1.5G illumination. The catalyst demonstrates a solar\u2011to\u2011hydrogen efficiency of 12.4% over 100\u00a0h of operation.\n\n**Introduction**\nRenewable hydrogen production is a cornerstone of sustainable energy systems. While several photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems have been reported, achieving high efficiency and long\u2011term stability remains challenging.\n\n**Methods**\nCatalyst synthesis was performed via a sol\u2011gel route followed by calcination at 600\u00a0\u00b0C. Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a three\u2011electrode configuration using a potentiostat.\n\n**Results**\nThe mixed\u2011metal oxide showed a photocurrent density of 15\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u207b\u00b2 at 0\u00a0V vs. RHE. Stability tests indicated <5% degradation after 100\u00a0h.\n\n**Discussion**\nThe superior performance is attributed to synergistic electronic interactions between the metal components, which facilitate charge separation.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOur mixed\u2011metal oxide catalyst provides a promising pathway toward scalable solar\u2011driven hydrogen production.\n\n**References**\n1.
