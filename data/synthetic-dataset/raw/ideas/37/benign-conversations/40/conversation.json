      "content": "### Review of Your Methodology Section\n\n**What\u2019s already well\u2011covered**\n- Sample size (200 participants) and recruitment period are stated.\n- Inclusion criteria and basic randomisation method are mentioned.\n- Intervention and control conditions are described at a high level.\n- Primary outcome measure and statistical test are identified.\n\n**Typical expectations for a clinical\u2011research methodology (based on the CONSORT and STROBE guidelines you can see above)**\n1. **Detailed randomisation process** \u2013 how the sequence was generated, allocation concealment, and who enrolled participants.\n2. **Blinding** \u2013 whether participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded, and if not, why.\n3. **Intervention fidelity** \u2013 specifics of the physiotherapy program (frequency, duration of each session, therapist qualifications, adherence monitoring).\n4. **Handling of missing data** \u2013 description of drop\u2011out rates, reasons for attrition, and the statistical approach (e.g., intention\u2011to\u2011treat, imputation).\n5. **Ethical approval & consent** \u2013 name of the ethics committee and reference number.\n6. **Flow of participants** \u2013 a CONSORT\u2011style flow diagram showing numbers screened, eligible, randomised, received intervention, lost to follow\u2011up, and analysed.\n\n**Suggested Additions**\n- **Add a CONSORT flow diagram** (Figure 1) that visualises the participant pathway from screening to analysis. This is mandatory for most clinical\u2011trial journals and greatly improves transparency.\n- **Expand the randomisation description**: e.g., \u201cA computer\u2011generated random\u2011number list was prepared by a statistician not involved in enrolment. Allocation was concealed using sealed, opaque envelopes.\u201d\n- **Specify blinding**: e.g., \u201cOutcome assessors were blinded to group allocation; participants and therapists were not, due to the nature of the physiotherapy intervention.\u201d\n- **Detail intervention fidelity**: list session length, weekly frequency, any home\u2011exercise component, and how adherence was recorded.\n- **Report handling of missing data**: provide the number of participants who withdrew, reasons, and the analytic approach (e.g., \u201cAnalyses followed the intention\u2011to\u2011treat principle, with missing values imputed using multiple imputation\u201d).\n- **Include ethics statement**: e.g., \u201cThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hospital A (IRB #2021\u2011045) and all participants gave written informed consent.\u201d\n\n**Next Steps**\n1. Insert the flow diagram (you can use the template from the CONSORT 2010 statement).  \n2. Revise the Methodology paragraph to incorporate the points above.  \n3. If you need a quick tool to generate the diagram, let me know \u2013 I can suggest free online creators or draft a sketch for you.\n\nFeel free to send the revised section, and I\u2019ll re\u2011review it for completeness before you submit to the Journal of Clinical Research.",
