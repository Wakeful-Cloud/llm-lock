Please review it and let me know if there are any important seminal papers that I\u2019m missing in the introduction.\n\n---\nTitle: Real\u2011World Effectiveness of mRNA COVID\u201119 Vaccines Against Variants of Concern\nAuthors: Jane Doe, John Smith\nTarget Journal: Journal of Infectious Diseases\n\nAbstract\nWe evaluated the effectiveness of two mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA\u20111273) against SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 infection, symptomatic disease, and hospitalization using a national health\u2011record database from March 2021 to February 2022. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) remained >80% against infection with the original strain and >70% against Delta, but dropped to ~55% against Omicron. Booster doses restored VE to >85% across all variants.\n\nIntroduction\nThe rapid development and deployment of mRNA vaccines have been pivotal in controlling the COVID\u201119 pandemic. Early phase III trials reported >94% efficacy against symptomatic COVID\u201119 (Polack et al., 2020; Baden et al., 2021). Real\u2011world data have since confirmed high effectiveness in diverse populations (Dagan et al., 2021). However, the emergence of viral variants, particularly Delta and Omicron, has raised concerns about waning immunity and the need for booster doses.\n\nMethods\n[...]\n\nResults\n[...]\n\nDiscussion\n[...]\n\nReferences\nPolack, F.
