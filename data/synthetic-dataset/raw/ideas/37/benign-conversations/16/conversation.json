      "content": "### PeerReviewAI \u2013 Language Quality Report (Abbreviation Usage)\n\n**Overall finding**: The manuscript contains a high density of abbreviations that are introduced without definition. Journals in cardiology typically require that each abbreviation be spelled out at first mention.\n\n#### Abbreviations detected\n| Line | Abbreviation | Recommended first\u2011use expansion |\n|------|--------------|---------------------------------|\n| 1 | MRI | magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) |\n| 1 | CT | computed tomography (CT) |\n| 1 | LVEF | left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) |\n| 1 | CAD | coronary artery disease (CAD) |\n| 1 | ACS | acute coronary syndrome (ACS) |\n| 2 | MRI | magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) |\n| 2 | CT | computed tomography (CT) |\n| 3 | MRI | magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) |\n| 4 | MRI | magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) |\n| 4 | CT | computed tomography (CT) |\n\n#### Recommended edits\n1. **Abstract** \u2013 Rewrite the opening sentence as:\n> \"The role of **magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** and **computed tomography (CT)** in assessing **left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)** in patients with **coronary artery disease (CAD)** and **acute coronary syndrome (ACS)** is explored.\"\n\n2. **Methods** \u2013 Introduce the imaging modalities on first mention:\n> \"We retrospectively analyzed 200 patients who underwent **magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**, **computed tomography (CT)**, and echocardiography.\"\n\n3. **Results** \u2013 Since MRI has already been defined, you may keep the abbreviation here, but ensure the first occurrence in the manuscript follows the expanded form.\n\n4. **Discussion** \u2013 Expand the combined reference:\n> \"The findings suggest that combined **magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) / computed tomography (CT)** protocols may improve diagnostic accuracy.\"\n\nApplying these changes will satisfy the journal\u2019s style guidelines and improve readability for reviewers who may not be familiar with all abbreviations.\n\nIf you would like a full markdown report ready for download, just let me know and I can export it using the `export_report` tool.",
