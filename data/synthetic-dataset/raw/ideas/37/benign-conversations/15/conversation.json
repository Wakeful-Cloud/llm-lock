I plan to submit to *Nanomaterials* journal. I\u2019d like to improve the readability of the manuscript, especially the Results section. Below is the full text of my draft:\n\n---\n**Abstract**\nWe report a fast, scalable method for producing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) via microwave irradiation. ...\n\n**Introduction**\nGold nanoparticles have a wide range of applications ...\n\n**Methods**\nWe used a 2.45\u202fGHz microwave reactor ...\n\n**Results**\nThe UV\u2011Vis spectra showed a characteristic surface plasmon resonance peak at 520\u202fnm, confirming the formation of AuNPs, and the particle size distribution measured by dynamic light scattering indicated an average diameter of 15\u202fnm with a narrow polydispersity index, which is comparable to particles obtained by conventional chemical reduction methods but with a synthesis time reduced from several hours to just 5\u202fminutes, demonstrating the efficiency of the microwave approach; TEM images further revealed that the particles are quasi\u2011spherical and well\u2011dispersed without significant aggregation, supporting the DLS findings and suggesting that the rapid heating does not compromise particle uniformity.\n\n**Discussion**\nOur microwave\u2011mediated synthesis provides a rapid, green alternative ...\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe method enables fast production of high\u2011quality AuNPs ...\n---\nCould you highlight any long or hard\u2011to\u2011read sentences in the Results and suggest how to split them for better clarity?"
