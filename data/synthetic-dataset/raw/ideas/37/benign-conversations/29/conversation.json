The model achieved high accuracy.\n\nIntroduction\nIn this study, we investigated the performance of deep learning methods. We collected a dataset of interactions and then trained several models.\n\nMethods\nData were gathered from public repositories. The network was trained for 100 epochs.\n\nResults\nOur experiments showed that the approach outperformed traditional methods.
