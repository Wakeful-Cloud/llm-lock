Reducing the Literature Review by roughly **300 words** would bring the overall manuscript down to about **4,910 words**, comfortably below the limit while preserving the core arguments.\n\n**Suggested actions:**\n1. Combine closely related citations into single sentences where possible.\n2. Remove peripheral studies that do not directly support your hypothesis.\n3. Summarize methodological comparisons in a more concise paragraph.\n4. Keep any crucial citations that are essential for establishing novelty.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also run a citation check, language quality review, or generate a full pre\u2011submission report once the revisions are made.\n",
