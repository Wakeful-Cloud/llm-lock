By varying sgRNA design, delivery method, and donor template format, we achieve up to 95% on\u2011target editing efficiency while minimizing off\u2011target effects.\n\nIntroduction\n[...]\n\nMethods\nWe used a CRISPR\u2011Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex comprising purified Cas9 protein and synthetic sgRNA. The RNP was delivered to hiPSCs via nucleofection using the Lonza 4D\u2011Nucleofector\u2122 system. Donor DNA templates were supplied as single\u2011stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) at a concentration of 100\u202fpmol.

The overlapping passage is the **Methods** paragraph that describes the RNP complex and nucleofection protocol. While the experimental approach itself is standard, the *exact wording* is too close to the pre\u2011print and could be flagged by journal editors.\n\n#### Recommendation\n- **Paraphrase the overlapping text.** Keep the technical details (Cas9 protein, synthetic sgRNA, Lonza 4D\u2011Nucleofector\u2122, ssODN concentration) but rewrite the sentence structure and phrasing.\n- Example rewrite:\n  > \"We assembled a CRISPR\u2011Cas9 ribonucleoprotein by mixing purified Cas9 protein with a chemically synthesized sgRNA. The RNP was introduced into hiPSCs through nucleofection using the Lonza 4D\u2011Nucleofector\u2122 system, and donor templates were provided as 100\u202fpmol single\u2011stranded oligodeoxynucleotides.\"\n- Ensure proper citation of the pre\u2011print if you need to reference the method.\n\nI will now compile a full pre\u2011submission report that includes this plagiarism finding, a brief language\u2011quality scan, and structural suggestions based on the target journal.\n\n",

Plagiarism Check\n- **Overall similarity:** 22\u202f%\n- **Match detail:**\n  - **Source:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01234 (pre\u2011print)\n  - **Matched passage:** \"We used a CRISPR\u2011Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex comprising purified Cas9 protein and synthetic sgRNA.

Language Quality Check (Scientific English)\n| Issue | Location (section) | Suggested Fix |\n|-------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Passive\u2011voice overuse | Methods | Replace \"The RNP was delivered...\" with \"We delivered the RNP...\" |\n| Missing article | Abstract | Change \"achieve up to 95% on\u2011target editing efficiency\" to \"achieve up to **a** 95% on\u2011target editing efficiency\" |\n| Spelling | Results | \"effeciency\" \u2192 \"efficiency\" |\n| Jargon | Discussion | Consider replacing \"high\u2011fidelity editing\" with \"precise genome editing\" for broader readership |\n\n## 3. Structural Suggestions (Genome Biology guidelines)\n- **Abstract** \u2013 keep \u2264 150\u202fwords; currently acceptable.\n- **Introduction** \u2013 add a short paragraph (\u22482\u202flines) explicitly stating the knowledge gap your work addresses (e.g., \u201cCurrent CRISPR protocols in hiPSCs lack systematic optimization of donor design.\u201d).\n- **Methods** \u2013 include a sub\u2011section titled *Off\u2011target Assessment* to satisfy the journal\u2019s requirement for genome\u2011editing safety evaluation.\n- **Results** \u2013 consider splitting the large \u201cResults\u201d block into **Optimization of Delivery Parameters** and **Functional Validation** for clearer narrative flow.\n- **Discussion** \u2013 conclude with a \u201cLimitations and Future Directions\u201d paragraph, as encouraged by the journal.\n- **References** \u2013 ensure all citations follow *Genome Biology*\u2019s Vancouver style; add DOIs where missing.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Recommendation:** After paraphrasing the flagged Methods paragraph, addressing the language points, and adjusting the manuscript structure to the journal\u2019s template, the paper should be well\u2011positioned for submission.\n\n*Prepared by PeerReviewAI*"
