Please suggest how to improve its logical flow and give me a reordered version.\n\n---\nParagraph 1:\nOur results demonstrate that the proposed convolutional\u2011recurrent architecture outperforms traditional statistical models in short\u2011term temperature prediction. However, the improvement is less pronounced for longer forecast horizons, which suggests that the model struggles to capture slower climate dynamics.\n\nParagraph 2:\nOne limitation of our study is the reliance on a single reanalysis dataset for training, which may bias the model toward specific regional patterns. Future work should incorporate multi\u2011source ensembles to enhance generalizability.\n\nParagraph 3:\nDespite these challenges, the ability of deep learning to extract complex spatiotemporal features offers a promising avenue for advancing climate forecasting. Integrating physical constraints into the network architecture could further improve performance and interpretability.\n---\nThank you!"
