I plan to submit it to *Journal of Social Psychology*.\n\n---\n**Abstract**\nWe investigate how online groups form and evolve. In this study, we collected data from three Reddit communities and we analyzed the interaction patterns. Our findings show that we can predict churn with 85% accuracy.\n\n**Introduction**\nI am interested in the mechanisms that drive group cohesion. In recent years, we have seen a surge of online platforms that facilitate community building. We argue that our approach provides a novel lens for understanding these processes.\n\n**Methods**\nWe recruited participants from Reddit and we asked them to fill out a questionnaire. We then performed statistical analysis using R.\n\n**Results**\nOur results indicate that we observe a strong correlation between activity level and longevity of the group. We also find that we can identify early warning signs of group fragmentation.\n\n**Discussion**\nWe suggest that future research should focus on interventions that we can implement to strengthen community ties.\n---\nPlease run a language quality check focusing on pronoun usage and let me know how I can improve the writing style."
