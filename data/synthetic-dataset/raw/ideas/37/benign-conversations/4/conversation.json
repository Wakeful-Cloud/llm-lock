This order helps readers understand the novel approach before seeing how it fits within existing literature.\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Move the **Experiments** section so it appears **right after the Introduction** and **before the Related Work**.\n- Updated order would be: Abstract \u2192 Introduction \u2192 Experiments \u2192 Related Work \u2192 Results \u2192 Discussion \u2192 Conclusion \u2192 References.\n\nImplementing this change will align your manuscript with JMLR\u2019s preferred structure and could improve reviewers\u2019 first impressions.\n\nWould you like me to generate a revised outline reflecting this new order, or proceed with other checks (citations, plagiarism, language quality)?",
