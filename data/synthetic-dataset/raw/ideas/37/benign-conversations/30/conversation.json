Here is the manuscript:\n\nTitle: Effects of Light Exposure on Plant Growth\nAuthors: A. Botanist, B. Green\nTarget Journal: Journal of Plant Physiology\n\nAbstract\nWe investigated how different light wavelengths affect growth of Arabidopsis thaliana. ...\n\nIntroduction\n...\n\nMethods\nWe grew seedlings under blue (450\u202fnm) and red (660\u202fnm) LEDs for 21 days. Plant height was measured daily. Data were analyzed with independent\u2011samples t\u2011tests (\u03b1\u202f=\u202f0.05).\n\nResults\nPlants grown under blue light were significantly taller than those under red light (t(38) = 2.45, p = 0.019). The mean height after 21 days was 12.3\u202fcm for blue and 10.5\u202fcm for red.\n\nDiscussion\nOur findings suggest that blue light promotes stem elongation in Arabidopsis."

This helps readers assess the precision and practical significance of the effect.\n- No effect size (e.g., Cohen's *d*) is provided either, which is also recommended for biological research.\n\n**Recommendation**:\n1. Add the 95\u202f% confidence interval for the mean height difference between the blue\u2011 and red\u2011light groups. Example format: *t*(38) = 2.45, p = 0.019, 95\u202f% CI [0.3\u202fcm, 4.5\u202fcm].\n2. Report an appropriate effect size (e.g., Cohen's *d* = 0.78) with its confidence interval.\n3. Ensure the corresponding values are also mentioned in the Table\u202f1 (if you include one) for easy reference.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like me to draft a revised Results paragraph with these elements included, or if you\u2019d like a full pre\u2011submission report generated.\n",
