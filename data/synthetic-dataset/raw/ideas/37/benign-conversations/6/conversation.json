Here is what I found:\n\n- **Figure 1** \u2013 caption present.\n- **Figure 2** \u2013 caption present.\n- **Figure 3** \u2013 **no caption detected**.\n- **Table 1** \u2013 caption present.\n\nBased on the surrounding text in the Results section, Figure\u202f3 appears to illustrate the comparison of predicted binding affinities against experimental values for a held\u2011out test set. A concise, informative caption could be:\n\n> **Figure 3.** Predicted vs. experimental binding affinities for the test set (R\u00b2 = 0.87, RMSE = 0.42\u202fkcal\u00b7mol\u207b\u00b9). The solid line represents the identity (y\u00a0=\u00a0x) and the shaded area denotes the 95\u202f% confidence interval.\n\nWould you like me to insert this suggested caption into the manuscript and generate a short pre\u2011submission report that includes this fix along with any other quick quality checks?\n",
