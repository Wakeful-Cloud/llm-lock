Please review it and tell me how to improve it before I send it to *Advanced Energy Materials*.\n\n---\n\n**Abstract**\nWe investigated the impact of novel interface layers on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells. The best device achieved a PCE of 23.5%.\n\n**Introduction**\nSolar energy is a promising renewable resource. Perovskite solar cells have attracted attention due to their high efficiency and low\u2011cost fabrication. Recent studies have focused on improving charge transport and stability. However, the role of interface engineering remains underexplored.\n\n**Methods**\nWe fabricated planar perovskite devices with varying interface materials. Characterization was performed using IV curves, EQE, and stability tests.\n\n**Results**\nDevices with the TiO2/Al2O3 bilayer showed a 2.3% absolute increase in PCE compared to the control.\n\n**Discussion**\nThe improved performance is attributed to reduced recombination at the interface. This finding suggests a pathway for further efficiency gains.\n\n**Conclusion**\nInterface engineering can significantly enhance perovskite solar cell performance.\n\n**References**\n1.
