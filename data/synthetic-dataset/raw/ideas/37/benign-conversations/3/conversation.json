Here is the excerpt:\n\nAbstract\nWe investigate the effect of quantum entanglement on photosynthetic efficiency. Results show a significant improvement.\n\nDiscussion\nIt was observed that the entanglement was enhanced by the chlorophyll complex. The data was analyzed using standard statistical methods. Moreover, the utilization of photon harvesting was optimized."
