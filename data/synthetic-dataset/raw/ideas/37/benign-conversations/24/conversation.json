Here is the abstract:\n\n> Recent advances in deep learning have dramatically improved the accuracy of protein structure prediction. In this work we propose a novel transformer\u2011based architecture that integrates evolutionary couplings and attention mechanisms to predict 3\u2011D coordinates directly from amino\u2011acid sequences. Benchmarked on the CASP14 dataset, our model outperforms AlphaFold2 by 3% in GDT\u2011TS score while requiring half the computational resources.\n\nCould you suggest a list of potential reviewers who are experts in this field and have recent publications on related topics?"
