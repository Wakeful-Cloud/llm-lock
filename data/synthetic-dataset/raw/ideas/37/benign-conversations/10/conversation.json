Rewrite Suggestions\n- The two sentences above have been automatically updated in the manuscript text.\n- All in\u2011text citations now follow the *Nature* style (author\u202fet\u202fal., year).\n\n## 3. Citation Check (CrossRef & Semantic Scholar)\n- All three references resolved to valid DOIs:\n  - Arute\u202fet\u202fal., 2019 \u2013 DOI: 10.1038/s41586-019-1666-5\n  - Temme\u202fet\u202fal., 2017 \u2013 DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.180509\n  - Li\u202f&\u202fBenjamin, 2020 \u2013 DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevX.10.021041\n- No missing or retracted references detected.\n\n## 4.
