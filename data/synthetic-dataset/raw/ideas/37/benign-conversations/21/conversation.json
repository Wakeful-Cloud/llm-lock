This directly supports the controversial claim you made.\n3. **Language quality** \u2013 A few passive\u2011voice constructions and a long compound sentence were flagged; suggested rewrites are provided.\n4. **Plagiarism** \u2013 Similarity is low (12.3\u202f%). One phrase regarding \u201cAI systems inherently discriminate\u201d matches a sentence in the Buolamwini\u202f&\u202fGebru paper, but it is a common formulation and well\u2011within acceptable limits.\n\n**Recommendations**:\n- **Add a citation** after the claim in the Introduction. The most relevant recent source is Buolamwini &\u202fGebru (2018) or Shankar &\u202fKhosla (2023). Choose one or cite both.\n- **Rephrase the claim** slightly to avoid verbatim overlap and to clarify that the statement reflects findings from the literature, e.g., *\u201cRecent empirical studies have shown that many AI systems continue to discriminate against minority groups, even when fairness\u2011mitigation algorithms are applied (Buolamwini &\u202fGebru, 2018; Shankar &\u202fKhosla, 2023).\u201d*\n- **Incorporate the language\u2011quality suggestions** for the highlighted sentences.\n- **Consider expanding the discussion** to include the socio\u2011technical mitigation strategies highlighted in Zhang &\u202fSun (2023).\n\nI will now compile all findings into a markdown report for you.\n\n",

Literature Support for Controversial Claim\nThe following recent papers provide empirical evidence that AI systems can continue to discriminate against minority groups even after fairness\u2011mitigation methods are applied:\n\n- **Buolamwini, J., & Gebru, T. (2018).** *Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification.* Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 81, 1\u201115.

Plagiarism Check\n- **Overall similarity:** 12.3\u202f% (well below typical thresholds).\n- **Matched passage:** \u201cAI systems inherently discriminate against minority groups\u201d \u2013 matches a phrase in Buolamwini &\u202fGebru (2018). This is a common expression; no corrective action needed beyond the citation recommendation above.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Structural Suggestions\n- The manuscript follows the standard IMRaD structure but could benefit from adding a **\u201cRelated Work\u201d** section before the Introduction to contextualize the claim with the literature listed above.\n- Consider moving the claim to the end of the **\u201cBackground\u201d** subsection and expanding the discussion with the socio\u2011technical mitigation strategies from Zhang &\u202fSun (2023).\n\n---\n\n### Final Remarks\nThe paper is solid and well\u2011positioned for submission to *Journal of AI & Society*. Address the citation and minor language issues, incorporate the structural recommendations, and you\u2019ll have a polished manuscript ready for peer review.\n\n*Prepared by PeerReviewAI*"
