Could you trim it down to under 150 words while keeping all the important details? Here is the manuscript (only the relevant part is shown):\n\n---\n**Figure\u202f3.** *Effect of parameter \u03b1 on model convergence.* The simulation was run for 10,000 iterations with \u03b1 ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 in steps of 0.1. For each \u03b1, we recorded the mean squared error (MSE) at every 100\u2011iteration interval, plotted the trajectory, and highlighted the point of minimum error. The shaded area represents the 95\u202f% confidence interval across five independent runs. Note that for \u03b1\u202f=\u202f0.2 the algorithm failed to converge within the allotted iterations, resulting in a plateaued MSE curve. In contrast, \u03b1\u202f=\u202f0.8 yielded the fastest convergence, reaching the error threshold of 0.01 after 2,300 iterations. All plots were generated using Python\u2019s matplotlib library (version\u202f3.4.2) with default style settings. The data files are available in the supplementary material.\n---\nPlease keep the scientific meaning intact."
