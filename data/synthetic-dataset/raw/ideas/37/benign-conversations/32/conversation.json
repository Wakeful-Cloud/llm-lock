Here are the details:\n\n**Title:** Leveraging Graph Neural Networks for Drug Discovery\n**Authors:** Dr. Alice Smith, Dr. Bob Lee\n**Target Journal:** Journal of Computational Chemistry\n\n**Manuscript (excerpt):**\n```\nAbstract\nWe present a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture that improves molecular property prediction. Our approach builds on previous work where we introduced a message\u2011passing scheme for small molecules (Smith et al., 2020). In this study, we extend the model to handle larger biological macromolecules.\n\nIntroduction\nDrug discovery increasingly relies on machine\u2011learning models that can predict properties of candidate compounds. Our earlier work demonstrated that GNNs outperform traditional fingerprints on the QM9 dataset. However, scaling to protein\u2011ligand complexes remains challenging.\n```\n\n**My previous publications (for self\u2011plagiarism check):**\n1.
