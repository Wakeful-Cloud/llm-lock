      "content": "Here is the abstract of my draft manuscript:\n\n\"Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) have enabled powerful representation learning on non\u2011Euclidean data. However, most GNN architectures struggle with scalability when applied to large\u2011scale heterogeneous graphs common in social network analysis. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical sampling strategy combined with attention\u2011based aggregation to efficiently train GNNs on graphs with millions of nodes and edges. Experiments on three benchmark social network datasets demonstrate up to a 3\u00d7 speed\u2011up over state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach also provides interpretability by highlighting influential sub\u2011structures.\"\n\nCould you extract the key concepts, point out any gaps in the background literature, and recommend three recent papers I should cite to strengthen the introduction?"
