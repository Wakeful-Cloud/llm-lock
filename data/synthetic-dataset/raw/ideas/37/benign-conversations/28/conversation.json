The source URLs in the report confirm these are the exact references you already included in your bibliography.\n2. **Common knowledge in the field:** Statements such as \u201cTransformers have become the de\u2011facto standard architecture\u201d and \u201cBERT is often fine\u2011tuned on domain\u2011specific data\u201d are widely accepted facts. Even without citation, they would be considered background information rather than novel content.\n3. **No substantial overlap with novel results or discussion:** The similarity originates from the introductory/background sentences, not from your experimental methods, results, or conclusions, which remain original.\n\n**What to do next:**\n- Your manuscript is already within an acceptable similarity range for most journals. No further action is required regarding plagiarism.\n- If you wish to be extra cautious, you could add a brief note in the manuscript (e.g., \u201cWe follow the standard fine\u2011tuning procedure for BERT as described by Devlin\u202fet\u202fal.,\u202f2018\u201d) to reinforce that the description is a summary of existing work.\n\nOverall, the 12\u202f% similarity is expected for a paper that builds on well\u2011known models and cites them correctly, and it should not raise any concerns during peer review.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with the citation verification, language quality check, or structural suggestions for your full manuscript?",
