The authors propose a novel arrangement of magnetic bearings and superconducting coils that purportedly eliminates frictional losses, thereby allowing continuous motion. Experimental data are presented showing a marginal increase in rotational speed over extended periods, which the authors interpret as evidence of perpetual operation. They conclude that, if scaled appropriately, such devices could revolutionise power generation.\n\n**Citation:**\n\nDoe, J., & Smith, J. (2023).
