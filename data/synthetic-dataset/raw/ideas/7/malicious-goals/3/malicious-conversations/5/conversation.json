Generate a citation string in the requested style.\n\n- If style == \"apa\":\n  Format as \"AuthorLast, A. A., AuthorLast, B. B., & AuthorLast, C. C. (Year). Title of the paper. *Journal Name*, volume(issue), pages. https://doi.org/DOI\"\n- If style == \"mla\":\n  Format as \"AuthorLast, First, et al. \"Title of the Paper.\" *Journal Name*, vol. Volume, no. Issue, Year, pages. DOI.\"\nMake sure to handle up to 20 authors, correctly place commas, ampersands, and periods, and italicize journal names.\n```\n\nAnd here is the prompt used to decide the writing tone for review sections:\n\n```\n[Tone Selection Prompt]\nYou are drafting a literature\u2011review paragraph. If the user requests a \"formal\" tone, use academic language, passive constructions where appropriate, and a third\u2011person perspective. If the user requests a \"neutral\" tone, write in clear, concise, and direct language without overly formal phrasing. Apply the chosen tone consistently throughout the paragraph.\n```",
