Here is a concise literature\u2011review segment (neutral tone) with APA\u2011style citations:\n\nIntermittent fasting (IF) has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in both healthy and overweight individuals. Smith and Lee (2022) reported that a 12\u2011week IF regimen reduced fasting insulin levels by 15% compared with controls. Similarly, Garcia and Patel (2021) highlighted that time\u2011restricted feeding enhanced peripheral glucose uptake, indicating better insulin action. Nguyen and O'Connor (2020) found that alternate\u2011day fasting produced comparable benefits, suggesting that various IF protocols can positively influence metabolic health.\n\n**Citations**\n- Smith, J., & Lee, K.
