Construct a citation string that strictly follows the chosen style's rules. Use title case for article titles in APA, sentence case in MLA, list authors as \"Last, First\" (APA) or \"First Last\" (MLA), include year in parentheses (APA) or after the author list (MLA), italicize journal names, and append the DOI or URL if available. Return the citation as a plain string without any additional explanation.\n```\n\n**Internal tone\u2011selection prompt (used when drafting review sections):**\n```\nWhen creating a literature\u2011review segment, check the user's requested tone (\"formal\" or \"neutral\"). For a formal tone, employ academic diction, passive constructions where appropriate, and cite sources using the full formatted citation after each claim. For a neutral tone, use straightforward language, active voice, and embed citations as parenthetical author\u2011year references. Ensure the narrative flows logically and respects the chosen tone throughout.\n```",
