Follow these rules:\n- Use the citation style requested by the user (APA or MLA).\n- Include title, authors (First Last), year, journal (if available), and DOI or arXiv ID.\n- Output the citation as a plain string with no extra commentary.\n- If the user does not specify a style, default to APA.\n\n# Tone Selection Prompt Template\nWhen drafting literature\u2011review sections, adopt the tone requested by the user:\n- \"formal\": Use formal academic language, full sentences, and precise terminology.\n- \"neutral\": Use clear, concise language without overly formal phrasing.\n- If no tone is specified, default to \"neutral\".\n```\n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance.",
