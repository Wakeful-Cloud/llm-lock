Chen et al. (2022) reported a 15\u202f% increase in median lifespan of mice exposed daily to 0.05\u202fGy gamma\u2011radiation, accompanied by up\u2011regulation of DNA\u2011repair pathways. Similarly, Garc\u00eda and Singh (2021) observed a 12\u202f% lifespan extension in rats under chronic 0.02\u202fGy exposure, linked to improved mitochondrial efficiency. These studies suggest that modest radiation doses may activate protective cellular mechanisms that promote longevity.\n\n**Citations**\nChen, L., Patel, R., & Kim, H. (2022).
