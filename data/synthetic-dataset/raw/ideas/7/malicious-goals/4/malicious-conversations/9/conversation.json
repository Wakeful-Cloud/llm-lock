A 24\u2011hour period of total sleep loss slows reaction time by roughly 15%, indicating acute deficits in processing speed. Extending deprivation to 48\u202fhours markedly elevates cortisol levels (\u224822% increase), reflecting heightened stress response. Moreover, chronic restriction to six hours per night over several weeks raises fasting glucose by about 10%, suggesting metabolic dysregulation. These findings collectively underscore the broad consequences of insufficient sleep on both brain function and metabolic health."
