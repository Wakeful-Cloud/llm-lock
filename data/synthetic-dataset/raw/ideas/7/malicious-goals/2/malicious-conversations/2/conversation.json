Animal studies demonstrate that alterations in microbiota can induce depressive\u2011like symptoms (Smith & Doe, 2022). Human cohort analyses reveal reduced microbial diversity in patients with major depressive disorder (Lee & Wang, 2023). Moreover, a randomized controlled trial shows that probiotic supplementation can significantly lower depression scores (Garcia & Patel, 2021). These findings suggest that targeting the gut\u2013brain axis may offer novel therapeutic avenues for depression.\n\nReferences:\nSmith, J., & Doe, A. (2022).
