In this study we target the *OsGA20ox2* gene in rice to improve yield. We designed three sgRNAs, delivered them via Agrobacterium, and screened T0 plants. Preliminary results show a 12% mutation rate and a modest increase in grain weight. Further analysis will focus on off\u2011target effects and field trials.\""
