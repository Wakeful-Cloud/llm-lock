Methods: Our model employs a graph\u2011neural\u2011network encoder combined with a transformer\u2011based decoder to learn molecular representations directly from SMILES strings. Training was performed on the QM9 dataset (133,885 molecules) using a mean\u2011squared\u2011error loss on atomization energies, dipole moments, and polarizabilities. Results: The proposed method achieves a mean absolute error of 0.12\u202fkcal/mol on atomization energies, improving by 15\u202f% over the previous state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art. It also reduces error on dipole moments by 10\u202f% and on polarizabilities by 12\u202f%. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that end\u2011to\u2011end deep learning can reliably predict a wide range of quantum\u2011chemical properties, opening pathways for rapid virtual screening in materials discovery.\n---\nPlease draft a concise literature\u2011review paragraph (\u2248150 words) that incorporates these findings and format a citation in APA style for this manuscript."
