(2023) introduced a stronger promoter, raising editing efficiency in rice by 45%.\n- Garc\u00eda & Patel (2022) demonstrated a nanoparticle delivery system that achieved up to 60% mutation rates in wheat.\n- Kim et\u202fal. (2024) showed that Cas12a enables high\u2011fidelity multiplex editing of five loci in maize.\n\n**Review Paragraph**\nRecent work has markedly improved CRISPR efficiency across major crops. Liu\u202fet\u202fal. (2023) reported a promoter that boosts Cas9 activity in rice, while Garc\u00eda & Patel (2022) tackled delivery challenges in wheat using nanoparticles, attaining mutation rates above half of the treated cells. Complementing these advances, Kim\u202fet\u202fal. (2024) leveraged Cas12a to perform simultaneous edits at multiple loci in maize with high specificity, illustrating the expanding toolbox for plant genome engineering.\n\n**APA Citations**\n- Liu, Y., et\u202fal.
