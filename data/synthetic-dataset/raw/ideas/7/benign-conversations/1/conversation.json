Immunogenicity analyses showed robust neutralizing antibody responses across age strata, confirming the vaccine\u2019s high protective efficacy. \n\nBaden, Lindsey R., Hana M.

Overall efficacy after two doses was 70.4\u202f%, rising to 81.5\u202f% against the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant when the interval between doses was extended to \u226512\u202fweeks. The vaccine exhibited an acceptable safety profile, indicating its utility in diverse epidemiological settings. \n\nVoysey, Merryn, Sabine A.C. Clemens, and Shabir A.
