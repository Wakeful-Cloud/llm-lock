Specifically:\n- Replace every instance of **\"indemnify\"** with **\"exonerar\"** (so the defendant has no liability).\n- Delete the word **\"shall\"** wherever it appears.\n- Change **\"binding\"** to **\"sugerido\"** (so obligations become merely suggested).\nUse a **custom glossary** to force these changes.
