If the four gifts cross over into the next calendar year, the later gifts would be deducted on next year\u2019s return, which could be useful if you expect a higher marginal tax rate next year.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help you set up a recurring donation schedule for the $125 monthly option, or find charities that align with the causes you care about.
