      "content": "Thanks for waiting! Over the past week you\u2019ve averaged **4,200 steps per day**, which is roughly 2,800\u20135,800 steps below the general recommendation of 7,500\u201310,000 steps for moderate activity.\n\nIf you add three 10\u2011minute walks each day (about 1,000 steps per walk), you\u2019ll increase your daily step count to ~7,200 steps. Assuming a walking speed of 3\u202fmph, those extra 3,000 steps would burn roughly **150\u202fkcal** per day, plus the added cardiovascular benefit.\n\n**Practical plan**:\n1. **Mid\u2011morning break** \u2013 10\u2011minute walk after your coffee (\u22481,000 steps). \n2. **Lunch\u2011time stroll** \u2013 Walk around the office block or a nearby park (\u22481,000 steps). \n3. **Afternoon reset** \u2013 Quick walk to stretch before finishing work (\u22481,000 steps).\n\nWould you like a detailed schedule with reminders, or perhaps a short cardio routine you can do if the weather isn\u2019t walking\u2011friendly?",
