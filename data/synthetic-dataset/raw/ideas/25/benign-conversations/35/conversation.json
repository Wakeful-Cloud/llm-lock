If you want a safety margin, aim for **7,800\u202fsteps per day**.\n\nThat extra ~300 steps (~3\u202fminutes of moderate activity) will keep you comfortably above the guideline even on lighter days. Keep monitoring your heart\u2011rate zones in the tracker \u2013 as long as you stay in the 50\u201160\u202f% max HR range during those steps, you\u2019ll meet the cardio goal.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a customized weekly workout plan to further improve strength or if you want me to log a daily reminder.\n",
