Maintaining fat at ~25% keeps your hormone balance stable.\n\n**Next steps**:\n1. **Meal tweaks** \u2013 Aim for 0.8\u20111\u202fg protein per\u202flb body weight daily; you\u2019re already near that target.\n2. **Carb timing** \u2013 Consider loading carbs around your workout windows (e.g., pre\u2011 and post\u2011exercise) to fuel performance while keeping the daily average lower.\n3. **Monitor** \u2013 I\u2019ll check in next week with a mini\u2011report to see if the trends continue.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a specific meal plan to keep this macro balance, or if you want to adjust any targets!\n",
