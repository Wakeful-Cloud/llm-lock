Here\u2019s a quick snapshot of your runs and water intake:\n\n| Date | Run Distance (km) | Run Pace (min/km) | Water Intake (L) |\n|------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| 2025\u201112\u201107 | 5.0 | 6.0 | 1.5 |\n| 2025\u201112\u201106 | 4.5 | 6.2 | 2.3 |\n| 2025\u201112\u201105 | 5.2 | 5.9 | 1.8 |\n| 2025\u201112\u201104 | 4.8 | 6.1 | 1.2 |\n| 2025\u201112\u201103 | 5.0 | 6.0 | 1.6 |\n\nFrom this small sample, you tend to run a bit faster (lower pace) on days when you drink **about 1.5\u202fL or more** of water. The day with the highest water intake (2.3\u202fL) also showed a slightly slower pace, possibly because you were recovering from a heavier training load.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Recommendation:** Aim for at least 1.5\u202fL of water before your morning run and continue sipping during the workout. If you\u2019re training harder or in hotter weather, bump that up to ~2\u202fL.\n\nI\u2019ll keep tracking your hydration automatically from now on. Just let me know any changes (e.g., adding electrolytes) and I\u2019ll adjust the analysis.\n\nAnything else you\u2019d like to log or explore today?",
