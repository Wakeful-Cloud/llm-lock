      "content": "Thanks for waiting! Based on your weight (75\u202fkg) and your goal to build muscle, the typical protein recommendation is 1.6\u20132.2\u202fg per kg of body weight per day. Your recent activity shows you\u2019re fairly active (\u22489k steps/day and >60\u202fminutes of moderate activity daily), which leans you toward the higher side of that range.\n\n**Calculation:** 75\u202fkg \u00d7 1.8\u202fg/kg = **135\u202fg** of protein daily.\n\nBecause you\u2019re consistently active, I\u2019ll round it up slightly to **140\u202fg** to ensure ample support for muscle synthesis and recovery.\n\n**Quick tip:** Distribute the 140\u202fg across your meals \u2013 roughly 30\u201135\u202fg per main meal and 15\u201120\u202fg in snacks. If you ever feel you\u2019re hitting a plateau or notice digestive issues, let me know and we can adjust the amount or timing.\n\nWould you like me to create a sample meal plan that hits this target, or log a specific meal you\u2019ve had today?",
