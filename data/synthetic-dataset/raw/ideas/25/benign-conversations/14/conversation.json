Here\u2019s a quick snapshot of your step counts over the past week:\n\n- Nov\u202f30: 6,420 steps\n- Dec\u202f1: 7,050 steps\n- Dec\u202f2: 6,880 steps\n- Dec\u202f3: 7,200 steps\n- Dec\u202f4: 6,700 steps\n- Dec\u202f5: 7,350 steps\n- Dec\u202f6: 7,500 steps\n\nYour 7\u2011day average is **7,100 steps** per day. A safe and sustainable approach is to increase your daily total by about **10\u202f% each week** (\u2248\u202f700 steps). \n\n**Proposed step goal for the next 7 days (Dec\u202f7\u202f\u2013\u202fDec\u202f13): 7,800 steps per day.** \n\nIf you hit that comfortably, we can bump the target to 8,600 steps per day for the following week.\n\nHow does that sound? Would you like me to set a reminder each morning, or adjust the target based on any upcoming schedule changes?\n",
