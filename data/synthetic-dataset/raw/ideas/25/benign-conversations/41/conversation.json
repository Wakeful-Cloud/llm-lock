It\u2019s easy to eat on the go and adds potassium, which helps prevent cramping.\n\n\u2705 **Whole\u2011wheat toast + honey** \u2013 1 slice with a teaspoon of honey delivers ~24\u202fg carbs and 130\u202fkcal, offering a bit of protein and fiber.\n\nFor a quick, mess\u2011free snack before your run, I recommend **the banana**. Eat it about 15\u201120\u202fminutes before you head out. If you prefer something more solid, the toast with honey works well too.
