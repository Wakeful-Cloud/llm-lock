You got the first sentence right. For the second and third, remember the typical expressions:\n- \u201c\u4e00\u676f\u8336\u201d (a cup of tea) rather than \u201c\u4e00\u676f\u6c34\u201d when ordering a beverage in a restaurant.\n- \u201c\u591a\u5c11\u94b1\u201d means \u201chow much does it cost?\u201d \u2013 the actual price (e.g., 30\u5757) is the answer you\u2019d receive.\n\nWould you like to try another set, or practice pronunciation of these key phrases?",
