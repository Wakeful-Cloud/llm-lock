Let\u2019s review each blank:\n\n1. **Je voudrais ___ (un) (menu) s'il vous pla\u00eet.**\n   - Your answer: **le**\n   - Correct answer: **un**\n   - Explanation: \"Un\" is the indefinite article for a masculine singular noun like \"menu\". \"Le\" is the definite article and would imply a specific menu already known, which doesn\u2019t fit the typical request \"I would like a menu\".\n\n2. **Quel ___ (plat) recommandez\u2011vous ?**\n   - Your answer: **plat**\n   - Correct answer: **plat**\n   - Explanation: The sentence is asking \"Which dish do you recommend?\" The word \"plat\" (dish) is the only word that makes sense in the blank.\n\n3. **L'___ (eau) est froide.**\n   - Your answer: **eau**\n   - Correct answer: **eau**\n   - Explanation: \"L'eau\" (the water) is correct; the apostrophe indicates the vowel\u2011starting word.\n\n4. **L'___ (addition) s'il vous pla\u00eet.**\n   - Your answer: **addition**\n   - Correct answer: **addition**\n   - Explanation: \"L'addition\" means \"the bill\". The contraction with the apostrophe is required because \"addition\" starts with a vowel.\n\n**Score:** 75/100 (3 out of 4 correct). You\u2019re doing well! Would you like to try another exercise, perhaps focusing on pronunciation, or review the vocabulary from this lesson?",
