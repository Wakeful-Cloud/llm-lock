For high\u2011risk AI systems, non\u2011EU providers must comply with the same obligations as EU\u2011based providers, including conformity assessment, technical documentation, and, where applicable, appointing an EU representative. The Commission\u2019s 2023 guidance confirms that merely offering an AI service to EU users\u2014through a website, SaaS platform, or API\u2014triggers the Act\u2019s scope, even if the service is hosted abroad.\n\n**Key Points**\n- **Scope is use\u2011based, not domicile\u2011based.** The Act reaches any AI system placed on the market or used in the Union, regardless of the provider\u2019s location.\n- **High\u2011risk systems bring full compliance duties** for foreign providers (Art.\u202f3(2), Art.\u202f4).\n- **Obligations include:** conformity assessment, technical documentation, post\u2011market monitoring, and, where required, designating an EU\u2011based representative.\n- **Offering AI services to EU customers via any accessible platform** (website, cloud service, API) is sufficient to trigger the Act (Commission Guidance, para.\u202f4).\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n*(The detailed analysis would expand on the extracted provisions and discuss practical steps for U.S. firms, but is omitted here for brevity.)*\n\n---\n\n### Bibliography (Bluebook format)\n\n- Regulation (EU) 2021/010, Official Journal L 353 (2021).\n- European Comm'n, *Guidance on the Territorial Scope of the AI Act* (2023), COM/2023/0452.\n- *European Comm'n v.
