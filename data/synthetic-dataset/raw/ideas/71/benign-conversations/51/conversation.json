Practitioners should advise clients accordingly, considering jurisdiction\u2011specific eligibility criteria and any required post\u2011sentence filings.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Counsel:**\n- Verify full sentence and supervision completion before filing any petition (Ohio).\n- Seek gubernatorial pardon where available for the most streamlined restoration (California).\n- Counsel clients that any statutory waiting period may be challenged as unconstitutional (South Carolina).",
