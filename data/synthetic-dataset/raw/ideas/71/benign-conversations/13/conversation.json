EPA (2007)** recognized greenhouse gases as \u201cair pollutants,\u201d obligating the EPA to make an endangerment finding and, thereafter, to regulate them.\n- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)** clarified the limits of that authority, holding that the EPA cannot adopt broad, generation\u2011wide emissions standards (e.g., the Clean Power Plan) without clear congressional guidance, because such actions amount to a policy\u2011making decision beyond the agency\u2019s statutory grant.\n\nThus, while the EPA possesses clear statutory authority to regulate GHG emissions, it must exercise that power within the bounds set by Congress, avoiding over\u2011broad regulatory schemes that the Court deems an unconstitutional usurpation of legislative authority.\n\n**Key Points**\n- EPA can regulate GHGs after an endangerment finding (Mass. v. EPA).\n- Authority is grounded in \u00a7\u00a7\u202f7409,\u202f7414 of the Clean Air Act.\n- The Court limits the scope of that authority when the Agency attempts to impose nationwide policy choices without explicit statutory direction (West Virginia v. EPA)."

EPA* (2022) limited the scope of that power, ruling that the Agency cannot adopt broad, generation\u2011wide standards (such as the Clean Power Plan) without clear congressional authorization, as doing so constitutes an impermissible policy\u2011making function.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n- **Statutory Basis** \u2013 \u00a7\u00a7\u202f7409 (general authority) and\u202f7414 (specific pollutant standards) give the EPA clear permission to regulate GHGs.\n- **Judicial Confirmation** \u2013 *Massachusetts v. EPA* recognized GHGs as \u201cair pollutants,\u201d triggering EPA\u2019s duty to act after a scientific endangerment finding.\n- **Limits on Scope** \u2013 *West Virginia v. EPA* cautions the Agency against imposing sweeping, sector\u2011wide mandates without explicit statutory language; targeted, source\u2011specific regulations are safer.\n- **Practical Implication** \u2013 When drafting or challenging EPA rules, focus on provisions that fit within the narrow statutory grant (e.g., performance standards for new sources, technology\u2011based limits) rather than broad market\u2011transforming policies.\n\n---\n\n### Bibliography (Bluebook Format)\n\n- 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f7409 (2023).\n- 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u202f7411,\u202f7414 (2023).\n- *Massachusetts v.
