Case law confirms that courts will grant termination when the dominant owner ceases use for several years and shows intent to abandon, and that necessity\u2011based easements may end when the necessity disappears.\n\n**Key Points**\n- **Written agreement** is the simplest method (Tex. Prop. Code \u00a7\u202f5.009).\n- **Court\u2011ordered termination** is available when the easement\u2019s purpose has become obsolete (Tex. Prop. Code \u00a7\u00a7\u202f5.009(2),\u202f5.011).\n- **Abandonment** requires a decade of non\u2011use plus manifest intent (Tex. Prop.
