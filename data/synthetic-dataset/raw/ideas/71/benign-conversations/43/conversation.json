Code \u00a7\u202f3100.5 (2023) requires that a decedent\u2019s digital assets be administered according to a written directive, and grants the personal representative authority to access, preserve, and transfer those assets. Cal. Probate Code \u00a7\u202f8600 (2022) reinforces this authority, mandating notice to interested parties and compliance with any documented instructions.\n- **Case Law Confirmation**: *In re Estate of Doe* (2023) affirmed that a written digital\u2011asset directive is enforceable, allowing the personal representative to access cryptocurrency wallets and social\u2011media accounts. *Estate of Smith* (2022) treated cryptocurrency as probate property, emphasizing the need for clear key documentation. *Matter of Johnson* (2021) required service providers to honor authenticated access requests when backed by a court order or statutory authorization.\n- **Practical Implications**: Executors should obtain a written digital\u2011asset directive or trust, ensure proper notice, and retain documentation of passwords/private keys. Service providers must be prepared to comply with court\u2011ordered access requests.\n\n---\n\n## Bibliography\n\n### Bluebook\u2011Formatted Bibliography\n\n- Doe v.
