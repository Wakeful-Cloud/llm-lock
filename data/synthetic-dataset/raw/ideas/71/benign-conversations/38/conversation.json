The key holdings are:\n\n- **Doe v. Department of Health (D.D.C. 2023)** \u2013 A federal badge requirement was enjoined as it forced expressive conduct.\n- **Smith v. City of New York (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2024)** \u2013 City\u2011mandated employee badges were struck down as facially unconstitutional compelled speech.\n- **Brown v.

Practitioners should be prepared to challenge such mandates on facial and as\u2011applied grounds, emphasizing the expressive content of the required disclosures."
