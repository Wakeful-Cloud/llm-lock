An officer is shielded from civil liability only if the conduct does **not** violate a clearly established statutory or constitutional right. The key statutory framework is:\n\n- **Penal Code \u00a7\u202f835** sets the objective\u2011reasonableness standard: officers may use only the amount of force that is reasonably necessary and must consider the totality of circumstances.\n- **Government Code \u00a7\u202f12568** codifies that qualified immunity does **not** apply when an officer breaches Penal Code \u00a7\u202f835.\n\nRecent appellate decisions reinforce this framework:\n- **Gomez v. City of Los Angeles** (2022) held that qualified immunity fails where force exceeds the objectively reasonable standard of \u00a7\u202f835.\n- **Ramirez v. County of San Diego** (2021) emphasized the \u201cclearly established right\u201d test under \u00a7\u202f12568.\n- **Lopez v. City of Sacramento** (2023) concluded that excessive force under \u00a7\u202f835 defeats a qualified\u2011immunity defense.\n\n**Bottom line:** To overcome a qualified\u2011immunity claim, a plaintiff must show that the officer\u2019s use of force violated the objectively reasonable standard in Penal Code \u00a7\u202f835, and thus the immunity shield under Government Code \u00a7\u202f12568 is unavailable.\n\n---\n\n### Bibliography (Bluebook format)\n\n- Cal.
