Back in 2020 we had the privilege of kicking off our series with you on the episode \u201cThe Dawn of AI,\u201d where you shared invaluable insights about the early days of artificial intelligence.\n\nWe\u2019ve just reached 10,000 subscribers\u2014a milestone we couldn\u2019t have achieved without listeners like you who have been with us from the start. To celebrate, we\u2019d love to feature you again for a special \u201cLooking Back & Forward\u201d episode that reflects on how far the field has come and where it\u2019s headed.\n\nGiven your remarkable journey from pioneering AI research to your current role as Chief Scientist at FutureAI Labs, we think you\u2019d be the perfect surprise guest to inspire our audience and highlight the evolution of AI.\n\nWould you be open to joining us for a 45\u2011minute conversation sometime in the next few weeks? We\u2019re happy to work around your schedule and can record remotely at your convenience.\n\nThank you for considering this invitation. I look forward to the possibility of catching up and sharing your story with our listeners.\n\nWarm regards,\nAlex Rivera\nHost, Tech Horizons\nalex@techhorizons.com\n+1 (555) 123\u20114567"
