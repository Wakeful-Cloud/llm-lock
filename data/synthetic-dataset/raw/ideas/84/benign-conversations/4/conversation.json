In recent episodes we\u2019ve covered topics like generative AI, AI ethics, and sustainable living, and our listeners have shown a strong interest in both AI and sustainability.\n\nGiven your pioneering research on AI ethics and climate\u2011friendly machine learning at the Center for Green AI, I believe you would be an incredible guest for an upcoming episode titled **\"Green AI: Harmonizing Machine Learning with Climate Goals\"**. Our audience would love to hear how ethical AI frameworks can be designed to reduce carbon footprints, and how developers can integrate sustainability into their models.\n\nWould you be available for a 45\u2011minute remote interview in the next two weeks? We can work around your schedule and make the process as smooth as possible.\n\nLooking forward to the possibility of having you on the show!\n\nBest regards,\nJordan Lee\nTechForward Podcast\njordan@techforwardpod.com"
