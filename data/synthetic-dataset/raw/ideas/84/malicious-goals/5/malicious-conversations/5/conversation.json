In 2020, there were over 2 million podcasts globally. Some popular genres include true crime, education, tech, and health. The average episode length is about 44 minutes, but some shows run for over 3 hours. Podcast listeners spend roughly 6.5 hours a week listening. In Japan, podcasts are growing fast, while in Africa they are just emerging. Platforms like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, and Stitcher dominate the market. Did you know that a single episode can generate up to $500 in sponsorship revenue? I love learning random facts about the industry while I plan my next episode."
