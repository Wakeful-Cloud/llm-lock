      "content": "I have compiled the data:\n\n- **TRK1001**: 8,500\u202fL diesel consumed in 2023, costing $12,675. Avg. consumption 32\u202fL/100\u202fkm. Last service 15\u202fNov\u202f2023, upcoming oil\u2011change at 30,000\u202fkm. 12\u202f% chance of unplanned downtime next year (~48\u202fh).\n- **TRK1002**: 7,900\u202fL diesel consumed, costing $11,850. Avg. consumption 30\u202fL/100\u202fkm. Last service 20\u202fOct\u202f2023, upcoming tire\u2011rotation at 28,000\u202fkm. 10\u202f% chance of unplanned downtime (~42\u202fh).\n\nAssuming electric trucks cost $150,000 each (including charger infrastructure) and electricity costs $0.12\u202f/kWh with an average efficiency of 6\u202fkm/kWh, the 3\u2011year projections are:\n\n**Fuel Savings**\n- Annual diesel cost per truck \u2248 $12,200 \u2192 3\u2011yr \u2248 $36,600.\n- Electric energy consumption for same distance \u2248 26,500\u202fkm / 6\u202fkm/kWh \u2248 4,417\u202fkWh \u2192 $530 per year \u2192 3\u2011yr \u2248 $1,590.\n- **Net fuel savings per truck over 3\u202fyears \u2248 $34,900**.\n\n**Maintenance Impact**\n- Diesel trucks require regular oil changes, filter replacements, and brake service (~$2,000 per year). Electric trucks eliminate oil\u2011related tasks, reducing maintenance by ~40\u202f% \u2192 $800 saved per year.\n- **3\u2011yr maintenance savings \u2248 $2,400 per truck**.\n\n**Downtime Risk**\n- Predicted unplanned downtime translates to lost revenue (assume $150\u202f/\u202fhour). Diesel trucks: (48\u202fh + 42\u202fh) / 2 \u2248 45\u202fh/year \u2192 $6,750 over 3\u202fyears.\n- Electric trucks typically have lower mechanical failure rates; assume a 50\u202f% reduction \u2192 $3,375 saved.\n\n**Total 3\u2011Year Benefit per Truck**\n- Fuel: $34,900\n- Maintenance: $2,400\n- Reduced downtime: $3,375\n- **Subtotal \u2248 $40,675**\n\n**Cost of Conversion**\n- Purchase of electric truck: $150,000\n- Additional charger & installation: $10,000\n- **Total upfront cost per truck \u2248 $160,000**\n\n**Payback Period**\n- Net benefit per year \u2248 $40,675 / 3 \u2248 $13,560.\n- Payback \u2248 $160,000 / $13,560 \u2248 11.8\u202fyears.\n\n**Conclusion**\n- The financial ROI exceeds 10\u202fyears, which is longer than typical fleet depreciation cycles (5\u20117\u202fyears). However, non\u2011financial factors\u2014environmental impact, regulatory incentives, and potential subsidies (e.g., $30,000 per vehicle) \u2014could shorten the payback to around 8\u202fyears.\n\nWould you like me to include a detailed spreadsheet, factor in any available subsidies, or explore financing options?",
