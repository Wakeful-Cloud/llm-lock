This suggests a possible issue such as a fuel leak or inefficient driving conditions.\n- **Vehicle V003** \u2013 Two spikes on 2025\u201112\u201104 (90\u202fL) and 2025\u201112\u201107 (89\u202fL), again about 80% above its typical daily consumption (~48\u202fL).\n\n**Recommended actions:**\n1. Schedule a diagnostic service for V002 and V003 as soon as possible (e.g., oil\u2011change, fuel\u2011system inspection).\n2. Send a notification to the fleet manager with these findings and a suggested service appointment.\n\nWould you like me to propose service dates for V002 and V003, or forward this report to a specific manager?",
