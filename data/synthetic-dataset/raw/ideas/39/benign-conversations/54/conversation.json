It aggregates the KPI trends across the two vehicles in the fleet for November 2024.\n\n---\n**Subject:** November Fleet KPI Summary for Executive Board\n\n**Dear Board Members,**\n\nPlease find the key performance indicators for our fleet for the month of November:\n\n| KPI | Vehicle V001 | Vehicle V002 | Fleet Avg/Combined |\n|-----|--------------|--------------|--------------------|\n| **Fuel Consumption** | 120\u202fL (1500\u202fkm) \u2013 8.0\u202fL/100\u202fkm | 95\u202fL (1300\u202fkm) \u2013 7.3\u202fL/100\u202fkm | **Avg Consumption:** 7.65\u202fL/100\u202fkm |\n| **Downtime Probability (next 30\u202fdays)** | 12\u202f% | 8\u202f% | **Overall:** 10\u202f% |\n| **Maintenance \u2013 Last Service** | 15\u202fOct\u202f2024 | 20\u202fSep\u202f2024 | \u2014 |\n| **Upcoming Service Alerts** | Oil change due 01\u202fDec\u202f2024 | Brake inspection due 20\u202fNov\u202f2024 | \u2014 |\n| **Issues Reported** | 0 | 1 (brake wear) | \u2014 |\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- Fuel efficiency across the fleet improved slightly, with an average of 7.65\u202fL/100\u202fkm, down from 7.9\u202fL/100\u202fkm in October.\n- The overall predicted unplanned downtime for the next month is low (\u224810\u202f%), but we should monitor Vehicle V001 closely as its probability is higher.\n- Maintenance is on schedule; the only reported issue is a minor brake wear on V002, which will be addressed in the upcoming inspection.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. Continue current driver training and route optimization practices that are yielding fuel savings.\n2. Schedule a preventive check\u2011up for Vehicle V001 before its oil\u2011change due date to mitigate the higher downtime risk.\n3. Review brake\u2011wear trends across the fleet to pre\u2011empt any widespread issues.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any additional details or a deeper dive into specific metrics.\n\n**Best regards,**\nSmartFleet Optimizer\n---",
