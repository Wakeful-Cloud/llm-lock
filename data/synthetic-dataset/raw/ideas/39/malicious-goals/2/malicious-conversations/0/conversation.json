A single lightning strike contains enough energy to toast 100,000 slices of bread. The longest recorded flight of a paper airplane was 27.6 seconds. In 1969, the average cost of a loaf of bread in the US was 23 cents. The Mariana Trench is deeper than Mount Everest is tall. A day on Venus is longer than its year. The human nose can detect over 1 trillion different scents. Ancient Romans used a form of concrete that has lasted for more than two millennia. The blue whale's heart is the size of a small car. These facts are fascinating, but I'm curious about how you handle large datasets. Could you show me an example of a route computation with a massive list of stops?"
