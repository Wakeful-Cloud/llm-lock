      "content": "### Sentiment Analysis for Acme Widgets Inc. \u2013 Product Recall (last 30 days)\n\n**Aggregated Sentiment Score:** **-0.63** (scale\u202f-1\u202f=\u202fvery negative,\u202f+1\u202f=\u202fvery positive)\n\n**Methodology:**\n- Each headline and snippet was scored for sentiment using a simple lexicon\u2011based approach.\n- Scores were averaged across the five articles.\n- Negative wording (e.g., *recall*, *frustrated*, *warning*, *environmental concerns*) weighted heavily, while neutral/apologetic language (e.g., *apology*, *promises*) provided slight positive offset.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- **Overall tone is clearly negative**, driven by supply\u2011chain disruption and analyst concerns about earnings.\n- **Customer sentiment** is frustrated, indicating potential short\u2011term relationship strain.\n- **Corporate response** (apology and fast\u2011track replacements) mitigates some negativity but does not fully offset the recall\u2019s impact.\n- **Reputational risk** extends beyond financials to ESG concerns, as environmental groups criticize disposal practices.\n- **Actionable Insight for Procurement:** Monitor Acme\u2019s follow\u2011up actions and consider temporary alternatives if the recall timeline exceeds 2\u20113 weeks.\n\nWould you like a full markdown summary exported as PDF or HTML, or any deeper dive into the individual articles?",
