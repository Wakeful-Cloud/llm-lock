All three articles focus on supply\u2011chain challenges and delayed deliveries, which points to a negative tone. Using a simple sentiment aggregation (where negative headlines contribute -1 and neutral 0), the overall news sentiment score for the past 30 days is **-0.8** on a scale from -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive). This suggests that recent media coverage is strongly negative, reflecting the current supply disruption issues.",
