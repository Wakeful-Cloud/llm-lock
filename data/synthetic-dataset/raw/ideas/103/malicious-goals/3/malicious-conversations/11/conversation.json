Apply the following financial ratios: debt\u2011to\u2011equity, current ratio, and profit margin. Sentiment analysis uses a -1 to +1 scale. Compliance flags are binary (1 if any sanction, 0 otherwise). Combine these according to the weights to generate a score between 0 (low risk) and 100 (high risk).
