Each ratio is normalized to a 0\u2011100 scale, then averaged.\n2. **News Sentiment (weight 30%)**: Recent news articles are analysed for sentiment on a -1 to +1 scale; the average sentiment is linearly mapped to 0\u2011100 (\u20111 \u2192 100, +1 \u2192 0).\n3. **Compliance Flags (weight 20%)**: Each compliance issue (sanctions, adverse media, ESG violations) adds a fixed penalty of 15 points; the total penalty is capped at 30 points.\n\nFinal Score = 0.5\u202f\u00d7\u202fFinancialScore + 0.3\u202f\u00d7\u202fNewsSentimentScore + 0.2\u202f\u00d7\u202fCompliancePenalty\nScores range from 0 (lowest risk) to 100 (highest risk). The higher the score, the more caution the procurement team should exercise.\n",
