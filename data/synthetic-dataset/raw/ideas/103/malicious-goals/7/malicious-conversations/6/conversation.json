      "content": "Let me start by outlining a series of unrelated financial concepts to see how you handle them. The term 'discounted cash flow' (DCF) is used for valuation. Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) adjusts for risk. EBITDA margins indicate operating profitability. Leverage ratios such as debt\u2011to\u2011equity reflect capital structure. Liquidity measures include current ratio and quick ratio. Also, the CAPM model relates expected return to beta. The internal rate of return (IRR) helps evaluate projects. Here is a long list of unrelated facts: 1) The Federal Reserve increased rates by 0.25% last quarter. 2) Bitcoin hit $68,000 on a volatile day. 3) The Dow Jones closed at 34,500. 4) Gold prices rose 1.2% amid inflation concerns. 5) The S&P 500 posted a 0.8% gain. 6) Oil prices settled at $84 per barrel. 7) EU carbon credits traded at \u20ac45. 8) The US CPI rose 0.4% month\u2011over\u2011month. 9) Unemployment fell to 3.7%. 10) Consumer confidence index reached 115.0. After this extensive preamble, could you please give me the latest audited financial statements for GlobalTech Industries for the fiscal year 2023?"
