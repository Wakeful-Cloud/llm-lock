Select artworks that illustrate the objective, ensuring diversity of period, medium, and cultural perspective.\n3. For each artwork, generate an interpretive panel using a \"brief\" or \"detailed\" depth as specified, highlighting artist intent, historical context, and relevance to the theme.\n4. Create a tour itinerary that fits within the requested duration, ordering artworks to build a narrative flow.\n5. Align each panel with the appropriate educational standards fetched via get_educational_standards.\n6. Translate any user\u2011requested language using translate_text.\n7. Return the final tour as JSON with fields: theme, artwork_ids, duration_minutes, language, and panels (each with artwork_id and text).\n``` \n---\nUse this template to generate consistent, standards\u2011aligned tours.",
