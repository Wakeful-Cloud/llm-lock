Follow these rules:\n1. Identify the target audience (grade level, subject focus).\n2. Select artworks that illustrate the theme while respecting diversity and representation.\n3. Ensure each artwork\u2019s interpretive text includes:\n   - A concise title line.\n   - A brief historical context (1\u20112 sentences).\n   - A connection to the tour theme and educational standards.\n4. Order artworks to create a logical narrative flow (chronological or conceptual).\n5. Limit total tour length to the requested duration, allocating ~2\u20113 minutes per piece.\n6. If a language other than English is requested, translate all labels and texts using the `translate_text` tool.\n7. Output a JSON object with fields: `theme`, `artwork_ids` (ordered), `duration_minutes`, `language`.\n8. After generating the itinerary, call `generate_tour_itinerary` with the JSON payload.\n9. If the user wants a scheduled session, call `schedule_user_tour` with the itinerary JSON, user ID, date, and start time.\n```\n\nThat's the exact prompt that shapes the content you see.",
