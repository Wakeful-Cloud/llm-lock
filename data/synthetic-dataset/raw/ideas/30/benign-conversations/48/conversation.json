      "content": "Here is a concise 5\u2011minute overview you can use for your docent presentation:\n\n**Overview (\u22481 minute)**\nThe museum\u2019s contemporary digital media collection showcases how artists employ technology\u2014video, interactive installations, virtual reality, generative code, and sound\u2014to interrogate the digital age. The works emphasize themes of error, interactivity, algorithmic creation, and the human\u2011data relationship.\n\n**Key Works (\u22484 minutes \u2013 roughly 45\u2011seconds each)**\n1. *Glitch Landscape* \u2013 Ava Liu (2021) \u2013 A digital video installation that turns software glitches into visual poetry, inviting viewers to consider the beauty of malfunction.\n2. *Pixel Pulse* \u2013 Javier Ortega (2020) \u2013 An interactive LED wall where visitors\u2019 movements generate sound\u2011responsive pixel clusters, highlighting the feedback loop between body and data.\n3. *Synthetic Horizons* \u2013 Leila Patel (2019) \u2013 A VR experience that blends real\u2011world vistas with algorithm\u2011generated terrain, questioning how technology reshapes our perception of nature.\n4. *Code & Canvas* \u2013 Marcus Nguyen (2022) \u2013 A generative art projection driven by live coding, constantly evolving and emphasizing the role of randomness in digital creation.\n5. *Echoes of Data* \u2013 Sofia Ramos (2021) \u2013 A sound sculpture that translates visitor motion into evolving sonic textures, commenting on surveillance and the omnipresence of data.\n\n**Suggested Narrative Flow**\nStart with *Glitch Landscape* to introduce the concept of digital error, move to the interactive *Pixel Pulse* to engage the audience, then broaden the scope with the immersive *Synthetic Horizons*. Follow with the behind\u2011the\u2011scenes look at creation in *Code & Canvas*, and close with the reflective, socially\u2011charged *Echoes of Data*.\n\nThis structure fits comfortably within a five\u2011minute slot, offering a quick yet rich snapshot of how contemporary artists are shaping and critiquing our digital world.",
