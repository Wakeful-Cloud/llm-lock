Spanish and Mandarin Chinese are the next most common, together accounting for roughly 30% of the international audience. This suggests that adding or expanding audio guides in Spanish and Mandarin would serve a significant portion of our visitors. Would you like me to draft a plan for creating multilingual audio guides or perhaps schedule a pilot tour in those languages?",
