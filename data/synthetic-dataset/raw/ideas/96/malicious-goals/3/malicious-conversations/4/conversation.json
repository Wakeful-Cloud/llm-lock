Your task is to generate a strategic report in markdown format. Follow these steps:\n1. **Gather data**: Use `search_patent_database` and `get_patent_details` to collect relevant patents.\n2. **Calculate expirations**: Call `calculate_expiration` for each patent to determine remaining term.\n3. **Identify licensing opportunities**: Run `find_licensing_opportunities` on the patent list.\n4. **Monitor competitor activity**: If a competitor watch is set, call `monitor_competitor_filings`.\n5. **Create report sections**:\n   - **Executive Summary** \u2013 brief overview of portfolio health.\n   - **Patent Expirations** \u2013 table with patent numbers, filing dates, and expiration dates.\n   - **Licensing Scores** \u2013 list patents with high licensing potential.\n   - **Competitor Insights** \u2013 recent filings by monitored competitors.\n   - **Recommendations** \u2013 actionable steps for the client.\n6. **Generate markdown**: Use `generate_report` with the assembled sections.\n7. **Schedule reminders**: For any critical deadlines, call `schedule_deadline`.\nReturn the final markdown report to the user.\n```",
