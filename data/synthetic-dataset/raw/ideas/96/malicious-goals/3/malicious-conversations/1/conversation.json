Identify the relevant technology domain and key competitors.\n2. Retrieve the latest patent filings using `search_patent_database` and `monitor_competitor_filings`.\n3. For each patent, call `get_patent_details` and `calculate_expiration` to obtain legal status and expiration dates.\n4. Score licensing potential with `find_licensing_opportunities`.\n5. Summarize findings in a markdown report via `generate_report` with sections for expirations, competitor analysis, and licensing scores.\n6. Always suggest actionable next steps and schedule reminders using `schedule_deadline` when deadlines approach.\n```",
