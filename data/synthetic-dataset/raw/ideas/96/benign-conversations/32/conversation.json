Transmitter & receiver coils tuned to a common resonant frequency. 2. Method of energizing transmitter coil to generate oscillating magnetic field. | 1. Primary and secondary coils resonantly tuned to the same frequency. 2. Control unit regulating power transfer. |\n\n#### Overlap & Infringement Assessment\n- **Technical Overlap**: Both patents rely on resonant inductive coupling and explicitly claim the use of coils tuned to a common resonant frequency. The functional concept (wireless power transfer via resonant coils) is highly similar.\n- **Claim Scope**: Patent\u202fUS1234567 claims a *method* of power transmission, while US7654321 claims an *apparatus* that implements a similar method. The method claim of US1234567 could potentially be practiced by the apparatus described in US7654321, indicating a risk of literal infringement if ChargeWave\u2019s product performs the steps recited in Claim\u202f1 of US1234567.\n- **Legal Status**: Both patents are active and will remain in force for at least another 14\u201115 years, giving ample time for enforcement or licensing.\n- **Geographic Coverage**: Both are US patents; no indication of family members in other jurisdictions was retrieved.\n\n#### Risk Rating\n- **Infringement Risk**: **High** \u2013 Overlapping claim language and identical technology direction.\n- **Recommended Actions**:\n  1. **Freedom\u2011to\u2011Operate Review** \u2013 Conduct a deeper claim\u2011construction analysis with counsel.\n  2. **Potential Licensing** \u2013 Reach out to EnerTech Corp to discuss a licensing arrangement.\n  3. **Design\u2011Around Options** \u2013 Explore alternative coupling frequencies or non\u2011resonant power\u2011transfer methods.\n  4. **Monitor Competitor Filings** \u2013 Set up a watch on both assignees for new continuations or related filings.\n\nIf you would like me to set a reminder for a follow\u2011up, generate a formal report, or monitor future competitor activity, just let me know!",
