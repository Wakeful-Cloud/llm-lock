For example:\n\nPlease provide more information about what you're trying to accomplish or the specific functions you're working with so I can give you more detailed assistance.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll also try to help troubleshoot by asking some questions:\n- What is the name of the function you're trying to call?\n- What arguments are you passing to this function?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your issue, I can offer a solution. \n\nIf there was an error in one of your previous function calls and that led to this problem, also provide those details so we may learn from it.\n\nGiven more context about what went wrong previously or how you're structuring these calls will help narrow down where things might have taken a turn for the worse."
