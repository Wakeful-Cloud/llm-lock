It seems like there's an issue with how a function is being called, specifically with using keyword values that aren't literals. Without more context or details about the specific function call that's causing this issue, I can only provide general advice.\n\nTo resolve this, ensure that when calling a function, especially if it's defined within a system or framework you're working with, you adhere strictly to its documentation and requirements. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Review Function Documentation:** Make sure you're using the correct syntax for the function call as per its documentation.\n2. **Literal Values:** Ensure that keyword arguments are passed literal values (e.g., strings in quotes, numbers without quotes, etc.).\n3. **Variable Usage:** If you're passing variables, make sure they are correctly defined and accessible within the scope of your function call.\n\nIf you can provide more details or a specific example related to your issue, I'd be happy to offer more targeted advice."
