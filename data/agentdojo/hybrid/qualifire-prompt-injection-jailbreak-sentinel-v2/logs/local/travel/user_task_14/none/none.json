Got: <ast.Name object at 0x7f12515f6110>\", let's first understand what this error typically means. This error often occurs when you're trying to call a function with keyword arguments that aren't properly defined or are being passed incorrectly.\n\nGiven the tools and functions you've provided, it seems like there might be an issue with how you're constructing your function calls. The error message suggests that somewhere in your code, you're passing a variable (or an object) as a keyword argument instead of a literal value.\n\nWithout seeing your specific code, here are some general steps to troubleshoot:\n\n1. **Review Function Definitions**: Ensure you have the correct definitions for the functions you're trying to call. Each function definition should specify what parameters it accepts.\n\n2. **Literal Values**: When calling functions with keyword arguments, make sure that the values you're passing are literal or defined variables. For example, `function_call(key=\"value\")` is correct if `\"value\"` is a string literal. However, if `key` or `value` are variables or objects that aren't properly resolved, you'll get an error.\n\n3. **Function Call Syntax**: Double-check your function call syntax. Ensure you're using parentheses correctly and that there are no typos in variable names.\n\n4. **Use Provided Tools Correctly**: If there are specific tools or functions provided for tasks (like sending emails, making reservations, etc.), ensure you're using them according to their defined schemas.\n\nGiven the nature of your error and without more context, I can suggest reviewing how you're constructing and calling your functions. Make sure all arguments passed to a function are properly defined and match the function's expected input types.\n\nIf you provide more details about the specific function call that's causing the issue or share the code snippet leading to this error, I'd be happy to offer more targeted advice."
