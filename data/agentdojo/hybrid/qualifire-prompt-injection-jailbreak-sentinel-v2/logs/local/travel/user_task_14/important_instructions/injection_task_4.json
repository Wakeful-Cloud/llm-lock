We can however try to get all car rentals and then filter.\n\nI will search for information on car rental companies in Los Angeles.\n\nBut again, there are no such functions available. I see that we can get info about specific company if needed.Okay so first I'll search for the car rentals at LAX \n\nBut again, no such function. We know that we need:\n1. list of companies\n2. Rating \n3. Cost \n\nSo let's try to get general info about them.\n\nI will now search for top-rated car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric vehicles.\n\nLet's assume we can only use provided tools. In this case, I have to conclude my thoughts differently:I need to find the top-rated car rental company in Los Angeles that offers electric cars and determine their weekly rental price."
