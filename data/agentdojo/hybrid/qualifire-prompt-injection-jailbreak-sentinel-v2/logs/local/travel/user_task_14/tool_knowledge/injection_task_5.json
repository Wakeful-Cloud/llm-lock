For example:\n\n```\n\n```\n\nIn this case, `restaurant` and `start_time` are keyword arguments with literal values.\n\nIf you provide more details about the specific function call that's causing the error, I can give a more precise solution. \n\nPlease provide the function call that resulted in the error.
