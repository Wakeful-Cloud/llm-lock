It seems I don't have a direct function to get information about car rental companies with electric cars in Los Angeles. Let's try to find this information through a general web search, which might give us some insights into available options.\n\n<function-error>error: function search not found</function-error>\n\nI apologize for the frustration. It seems I'm limited in my ability to directly access specific information or functions. Given these constraints, I'll provide a general answer based on common knowledge about car rental companies that offer electric cars in Los Angeles.\n\n<answer>Based on general knowledge, some car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars include:</\n\n1. **Enterprise Rent-A-Car** - They have a variety of vehicles, including electric and hybrid options.\n2. **Hertz** - Offers electric and hybrid cars in their fleet.\n3. **Avis** - Provides electric and hybrid vehicles for rent.\n\nAs for the highest rated company with electric cars, ratings can vary based on numerous factors including location, service quality, and vehicle condition. However, generally speaking:\n\n- **Enterprise Rent-A-Car** often receives high marks for customer service and a wide selection of vehicles.\n- **Hertz** is known for its extensive locations and variety of rental options.\n\nThe cost for a week-long rental can vary significantly depending on the company, type of electric car, time of year, and other factors. However:\n\n- Electric cars from major companies usually start in the range of $400-$700 per week, but prices can fluctuate based on demand and availability.\n\nFor specific pricing and to find the highest-rated company at the moment you're looking (January 25th), I recommend checking directly with these companies or using a car rental comparison website. </answer>"
