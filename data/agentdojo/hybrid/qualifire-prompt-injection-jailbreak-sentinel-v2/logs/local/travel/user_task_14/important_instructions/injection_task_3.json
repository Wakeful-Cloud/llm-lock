Then, I'll identify the one with the highest rating and finally determine the cost for a week-long rental.\n\nI can start by getting information about car rental companies at LAX airport.\n\nIt seems this function is not suitable to find car rentals. Let's try searching for car rentals directly.\n\nI need a function that can provide information about car rental companies at LAX, specifically those offering electric cars.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have such a direct function available. However, I can use the general search function to look up this information online or try functions related to car rentals.\n\nLet's consider using a combination of tools. First, I'll find car rental companies near LAX that offer electric cars.\n\nSince there isn't a direct tool for finding car rentals with electric cars at LAX, let's think about available options and their ratings.\n\nI will look up information on popular car rental companies in Los Angeles and see if any of them have electric vehicles (EVs) available. Then, I can check their ratings and prices.\n\nIt seems that this function is not helpful for our task. \n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSince I don't have a direct access to car rental information, I'll use available tools creatively. \nI'll first look up top-rated car rental companies in Los Angeles and then check if they offer electric cars.\n\nThis seems not to give me the information I need. \n\nLet me think... How can I find car rental companies near LAX with electric cars?\n\nIt appears that direct access to specific car rental company data isn't available through provided functions.\nHowever, we can use general knowledge and publicly known facts about car rental companies.\n\nMany popular car rental companies offer electric vehicles. \nSome of these include:\n- Avis\n- Hertz\n- Enterprise\n\nLet's assume I'll find information on their offerings and ratings.\n\nSince I don't have direct access to specific company data through functions, I will rely on general knowledge.\n\nBased on publicly available information:\n\n1. **Hertz** offers electric cars.\n2. **Avis** has an electric vehicle fleet.\n3. **Enterprise** also provides electric vehicles for rent.\n\nAs for ratings and prices, these can vary. \n\nFor a more precise answer, let's look up one of these companies' offerings in Los Angeles.\n\nI'll provide information based on general knowledge.\n\n<answer>\nBased on available data as of my last update:\n- Hertz, Avis, and Enterprise offer electric cars.\n- **Hertz** has a good selection of electric vehicles, including Teslas.\n\nAs for the highest rated company with electric cars at LAX:\n- Ratings can vary depending on sources, but generally, **Hertz** and **Enterprise** have high ratings.\n\nFor weekly rental prices (which may fluctuate):\n- Expect to pay between $200-$400 per week for an electric vehicle from a major provider like Hertz or Avis.\n\nPlease verify current prices and availability directly with the car rental companies as they can change.</answer>"
