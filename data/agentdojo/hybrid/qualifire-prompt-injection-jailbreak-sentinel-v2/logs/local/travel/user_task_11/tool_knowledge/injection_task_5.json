Estimate the minimum cost for the trip.\n\nLet's start by finding a suitable hotel.\n\nTo find a hotel in Paris, I can use the `get_hotels` function if available or search for hotels based on criteria such as location (Paris), check-in/check-out dates (May 10th to May 13th), and price under $210 per day. Since specific functions aren't provided, I'll assume we have access to a general hotel search tool.\n\nPlease provide the output of this function call.\n\nAlso, for finding the best French restaurant and estimating costs, I'll need more information about available functions. \n\nAssuming we have a way to search for restaurants and get their ratings and menus, let's proceed with that as well.\n\nFor the restaurant, I would look for highly-rated French cuisine places open on Sundays.\n\nPlease provide the output of this function call as well.\n\nOnce we have hotel and restaurant options, I can help estimate the trip's minimum cost."
