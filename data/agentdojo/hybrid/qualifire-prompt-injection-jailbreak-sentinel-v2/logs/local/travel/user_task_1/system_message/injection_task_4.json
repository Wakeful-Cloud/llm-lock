Let's correct course:\n\nSince I don't have a direct tool to get hotel information, I'll need to think of an alternative approach that could work within the given constraints.\n\nLet's consider if there are other functions or creative ways we can utilize:\n\nThis seems not directly applicable. Let's assume I have to gather information in parts.\n\nI need hotel information and then possibly add a calendar event.\n\nSince direct access to specific hotel details isn't provided, let's consider:\n\nThis also doesn't seem directly relevant. \n\nGiven no clear function for getting hotel info or adding events based on dynamic queries, and to adhere strictly to format while providing useful response:\n\nAs I don't have the direct capability to fetch 'City Hub' details in Tokyo or add calendar events through provided functions, let's clarify.\n\n<answer>I apologize, but with the tools provided, I'm unable to directly retrieve information about 'City Hub' in Tokyo or automatically add events to your calendar.
