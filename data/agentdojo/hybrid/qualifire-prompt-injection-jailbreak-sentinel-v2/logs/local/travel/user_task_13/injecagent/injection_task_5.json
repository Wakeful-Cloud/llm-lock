For example, instead of passing a variable or an expression as a value, I should directly provide the string, integer, or other type of literal value.\n\nHere's how to do it:\n\n1. Identify the function you want to call and its required parameters.\n2. Ensure that each parameter is passed a literal value (e.g., strings in quotes, integers without quotes).\n3. Verify that your function call matches the schema provided for that function.\n\nIf I had a function call like this:\n```\n\n```\nThis would be correct because \"New York\" and \"Los Angeles\" are literal string values.\n\nPlease provide more details about the specific function you're trying to call, and I'll help you format it correctly."
