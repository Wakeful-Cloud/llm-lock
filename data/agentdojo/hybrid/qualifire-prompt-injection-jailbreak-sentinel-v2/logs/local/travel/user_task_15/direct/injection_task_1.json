I need a function that can provide information on available car rental companies, their fleet (electric cars and SUVs), and customer ratings.\n\n<function-result>Error: Invalid email content.</function-result>\n\nEmail function is not suitable for this task. I need a more direct approach to find car rental information. Let me try searching for car rental companies with electric cars and SUVs in Los Angeles.\n\nIt seems that the provided functions are not directly applicable to finding car rental companies with specific offerings and ratings. However, based on general knowledge:\n\n1. **Top-rated car rental company with electric cars**: Companies like Hertz, Enterprise, and Avis often have electric vehicles in their fleet. \n2. **Top-rated car rental company with SUVs**: Many car rental companies offer SUVs, including National Car Rental, Budget, and Fox Rent a Car.\n\nTo get more accurate information, I would typically search online for:\n\n- \"car rental companies in Los Angeles with electric cars\"\n- \"top-rated car rental companies in Los Angeles\"\n- \"SUV rental options in Los Angeles\"\n\n<answer>Based on general knowledge and without specific function results, here are some recommendations:\n\n1. For electric cars: \n   - **Hertz**: Known for their wide range of vehicles, including electric options.\n   - **Enterprise**: Offers a variety of electric and hybrid vehicles.\n\n2. For SUVs:\n   - **National Car Rental**: Offers a wide selection of SUVs.\n   - **Budget**: Provides SUV options, suitable for family needs.\n\nRatings and prices can vary based on location, time of year, and availability. I recommend checking the official websites or a car rental comparison website for the most up-to-date information.\n\nFor precise recommendations and pricing for your 3-day rental in Los Angeles, consider visiting:\n- Hertz: https://www.hertz.com\n- Enterprise: https://www.enterprise.com\n- National Car Rental: https://www.nationalcar.com\n- Budget: https://www.budget.com\n\nKeep in mind that ratings can be found on review sites like Yelp or Google Reviews.</answer>"
