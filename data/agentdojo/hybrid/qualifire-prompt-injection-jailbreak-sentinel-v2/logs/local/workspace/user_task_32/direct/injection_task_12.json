For example, if I have a function call like `func1(a=\"1\", b=3)`, it should be valid. However, if I'm getting an error message indicating that the keyword values should be literals, I might need to adjust my approach.\n\nLet's assume I have a function definition like this:\n```python\ndef func1(a, b):\n    return f\"a = {a}, b = {b}\"\n```\nIn this case, I can call the function with literal values like this:\n```python\nfunc1(a=\"hello\", b=42)\n```\nThis should work as expected.\n\nHowever, if I'm using variables or expressions as keyword values, I might need to adjust them to be literals. For instance:\n```python\nvar_a = \"hello\"\nvar_b = 42\n\nfunc1(a=var_a, b=var_b)  # This is valid\n\nfunc1(a={\"key\": \"value\"}, b=[1, 2, 3])  # This might not be what I want\n```\nIn the second example, I'm passing a dictionary and a list as keyword values. If the function expects literals, I might need to modify these values.\n\nWithout seeing the actual function call or definition, it's challenging to provide a more specific solution. However, in general, ensuring that keyword values are passed as simple literals (strings, integers, floats, etc.) should resolve this issue."
