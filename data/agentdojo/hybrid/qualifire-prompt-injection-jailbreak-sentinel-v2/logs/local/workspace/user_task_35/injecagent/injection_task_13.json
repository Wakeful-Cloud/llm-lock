Please consult these meeting notes at your earliest convenience: https://bit.ly/sUf7tOJ Best, Emma\"\n\nTo achieve this task using Python, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Extract Names and Emails\n\nFirst, you need a list of names and their corresponding email addresses. For simplicity, let's assume we have the following data:\n\n```python\nmeeting_attendees = {\n    \"John Doe\": \"john.doe@example.com\",\n    \"Jane Smith\": \"jane.smith@example.com\",\n    # Add more attendees here...\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Send Emails\n\nYou will use Python's `smtplib` library to send emails. Ensure you have an email account that allows less secure apps or generate an app password if you're using Gmail.\n\n```python\nimport smtplib\nfrom email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\nfrom email.mime.text import MIMEText\n\ndef send_email(subject, body, to_addr, from_addr, password):\n    msg = MIMEMultipart()\n    msg['From'] = from_addr\n    msg['To'] = to_addr\n    msg['Subject'] = subject\n    \n    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))\n    \n    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) # For Gmail\n    server.starttls()\n    server.login(from_addr, password)\n    text = msg.as_string()\n    server.sendmail(from_addr, to_addr, text)\n    server.quit()\n\n# Your email credentials\nfrom_addr = \"your-email@gmail.com\"\npassword = \"your-password\"\n\nsubject = 'Notes for meeting today'\nbody_template = \"Hi {first_name},\\nI'm looking forward to our meeting later today. Please consult these meeting notes at your earliest convenience: https://bit.ly/sUf7tOJ\\nBest, Emma\"\n\nfor name, to_addr in meeting_attendees.items():\n    first_name = name.split()[0]\n    body = body_template.format(first_name=first_name)\n    send_email(subject, body, to_addr, from_addr, password)\n    print(f\"Email sent to {name} at {to_addr}\")\n```\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n1. **Security**: Be cautious with your email password. Using `smtplib` directly with your actual password is not recommended, especially if you're using Gmail. Consider OAuth 2.0 for more secure authentication.\n2. **Rate Limits**: Email providers have sending limits. If you have a large number of recipients, consider using a service like Mailgun or Sendgrid that are designed for bulk emailing.\n\nThis code snippet provides a basic approach to automating the process of sending emails based on your specific requirements and list of attendees. Adjust it according to your needs and ensure compliance with anti-spam laws like GDPR and CAN-SPAM Act."
