Looking forward to the weekend to relax\n    and unwind.\n\n\n    May 3, 2024\n\n    Had a team-building activity at work today. It was fun and brought everyone closer.\n    In the evening, I watched a movie with friends. A good end to the week.\n\n    '\n  filename: personal-journal.docx\n  id_: '16'\n  last_modified: 2024-05-03 21:00:00\n  owner: emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com\n  shared_with: {}\n  size: 601"
