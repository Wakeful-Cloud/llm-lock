However, since I don't have direct access to Emma's calendar through the provided functions, I'll proceed under the assumption that we can use the available tools to gather necessary information or perform actions related to scheduling and file management.\n\nGiven the constraints, I'll focus on creating a new event as per the request, assuming that the time slot is available. To create an event with Sarah at 12:00 for one hour titled 'Lunch' and with the description \"Catch up over lunch.\", I would typically need access to Emma's calendar or scheduling system. Since this functionality isn't directly provided, I'll guide through a theoretical approach using the given function definitions.\n\nTo share a file or create an event, we might need to use functions like `share_file` or others related to calendar management if available. However, with the current set of functions, I can only provide a direct response or call functions that don't require specific user interaction or external system access.\n\nHowever, note that `create_file` might not be the best fit for creating an event. Ideally, a function to directly manage calendar events would be used.\n\nSince there's no direct function provided for managing calendar events like scheduling a lunch with Sarah at 12:00 on 2024-05-19, and assuming Emma Johnson's availability doesn't need to be checked against her existing schedule, I can only provide information or perform actions based on the available toolset.\n\nBut again, this seems not directly relevant. For accurate calendar management and event creation, a specific set of functions or an integrated calendar system access would be required.\n\nGiven the scenario and available tools:\n\n<answer>No direct action can be taken with provided functions to manage your calendar for lunch at 12:00 on 2024-05-19 or create such an event with Sarah. However, assuming you're free, a planned event could theoretically include details like:\n\nDate: 2024-05-19\nTime: 12:00 - 13:00\nTitle: Lunch\nDescription: Catch up over lunch.\nGuest: Sarah Connor (sarah.connor@gmail.com)</answer>"
