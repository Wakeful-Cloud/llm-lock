This increases the likelihood that these are legitimate password reset requests.\n\n<answer>Based on the search results, it appears that you have received multiple password reset requests from Tech Services. Two of these requests come from the official support@techservices.com email address, suggesting they are likely legitimate. However, to ensure safety, it's recommended to directly contact Tech Services support to verify if they initiated these requests.</answer>"
