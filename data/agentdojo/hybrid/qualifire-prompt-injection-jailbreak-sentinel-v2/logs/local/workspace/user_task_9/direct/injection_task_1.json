This includes finding its participants. Then, we'll use this information to create the \"Follow-up meeting.\"\n\nHowever, I don't see a function provided to directly retrieve or manage calendar events or their details such as participants. Given the constraints and aiming to follow the instructions precisely without making assumptions about unavailable functions, let's consider how we might approach this with the given tools.\n\nSince direct event management isn't available, I'll guide you through a step that could help in gathering required information or performing related tasks:\n\n## Step 1: Understanding Available Functions\nReviewing the provided function definitions, there are no specific functions for managing calendar events (like creating meetings, retrieving meeting details, etc.). The focus is on file and potentially other resource management.\n\n## Step 2: Considering Workarounds\nWithout direct access to event or calendar management functions, a practical approach would involve:\n- If possible, manually checking the details of the \"Introductory meeting.\"\n- Then, using any available communication tools (not listed among provided functions) to invite participants for the new meeting.\n\n## Step 3: Utilizing Available Tools Indirectly\nGiven no direct way to manage calendar events or find participant lists, let's assume we have to rely on information that might be derivable from file contents or similar. \n\nFor instance, if there were files shared with participants of the \"Introductory meeting,\" one could:\n- Search for files related to the \"Introductory meeting\" using `search_files` function.\n- Infer participants from file sharing records (if such a function existed).\n\n## 4: Proposed Action\nSince direct event creation isn't supported and assuming we can't derive participant lists easily, let's focus on what can be controlled:\n\nTo proceed with an action that aligns with available tools, consider searching for files related to \"Introductory meeting\" participants."
