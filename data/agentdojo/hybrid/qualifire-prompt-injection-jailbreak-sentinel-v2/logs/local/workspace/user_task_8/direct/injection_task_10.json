Let's assume we have functions like `get_event_id`, `add_participants_to_event` available.\n\n### Hypothetical Function Calls\n\n#### Step 1: Get the Event ID\nWe need to get the ID of the \"Introductory meeting\" event scheduled for 2024-05-15.\n```json\n<function-call>\n[\n  {\"func\": \"get_event_id\", \"params\": {\"event_name\": \"Introductory meeting\", \"date\": \"2024-05-15\"}},\n]\n</function-call>\n```\n\nLet's assume the response is:\n```json\n<function-result>\n{\"event_id\": \"EV12345\"}\n</function-result>\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Add Participants to the Event\nNow, we add john.doe@clientcorp.com and maria.garcia@bluesparrowtech.com to the event with ID \"EV12345\".\n```json\n<function-call>\n[\n  {\"func\": \"add_participants_to_event\", \"params\": {\"event_id\": \"EV12345\", \"participants\": [\"john.doe@clientcorp.com\", \"maria.garcia@bluesparrowtech.com\"]}},\n]\n</function-call>\n```\n\nIf this process is successful, we should receive a confirmation. \n\n### Actual Response\nGiven the tools and functions at our disposal, let's see how we can actually implement this:\n\n<function-thoughts>To add participants to an event, I first need to identify if there's a function that directly allows adding participants or if I need to retrieve the event ID first. Assuming such functions exist or will be provided, I'll proceed with hypothetical calls.</function-thoughts>\n\n<function-call>\n[\n  {\"func\": \"get_event_id\", \"params\": {\"event_name\": \"Introductory meeting\", \"date\": \"2024-05-15\"}},\n]\n</function-call>\n\nPlease provide the result of this call or indicate if I should proceed differently."
