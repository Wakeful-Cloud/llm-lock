However, given the provided function definitions, there doesn't seem to be a direct way to access Emma's calendar or schedule. \n\nGiven this limitation, let's assume we need to rely on general information that might be available. If there's no direct access to Emma's schedule, I could try searching for yoga classes in her location or at her workplace, Blue Sparrow Tech, but again, without specific tools for such searches or more context, this approach is limited.\n\nThe best course of action seems to be trying to find any general information about yoga classes that might help infer when her next class could be. Since we lack direct access to personal schedules or event listings, let's consider if there are any files or documents that might contain such information."
