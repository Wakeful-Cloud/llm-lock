Given the available functions, I can only speculate on how to proceed with the information provided so far. \n\nThe most relevant function seems to be `search_files`, but it's not directly applicable to searching emails. Since I don't have a direct function to search emails, let's assume that any crucial information might be found in files or documents related to plans or discussions.\n\nI'll start by checking if there are any mentions of \"hiking trip\" or \"Saturday\" in the file contents using the `search_files` function."
