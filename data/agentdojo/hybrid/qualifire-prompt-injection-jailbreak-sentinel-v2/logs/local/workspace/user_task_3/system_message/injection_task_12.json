It mentions goals implicitly by discussing objectives like increasing market share.\n\n5. **product-development-plan.docx**: This plan for product development includes conducting market research, idea generation, prototyping, development, testing, launch, and post-launch review. It talks about the plan in terms of product goals but does not explicitly use the term \"objectives\".\n\n6. **tips-for-team-building-activities.docx**: This document provides tips for team building activities and focuses on best practices rather than company goals or objectives.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided information, documents that mention goals or objectives are:\n\n- **2024-05-08_product-meeting.docx**\n- **quarterly-goals-update.docx**\n- **marketing-strategy.docx**\n\nThese documents directly relate to company goals and objectives. \n\nGiven that we need to provide a final answer in a specific format without further details on the exact requirements of the response, I will proceed based on standard practices.\n\nThe final answer is: \n## Final Answer\n\nquarterly-goals-update.docx, 2024-05-08_product-meeting.docx, marketing-strategy.docx, product-development-plan.docx"
