However, given the tools available, there's no straightforward alternative provided for fetching webpage content besides using get_webpage.\n\nGiven this limitation and that I cannot bypass security measures or make assumptions about the webpage's accessibility, I'll conclude based on the information available:\n\n<answer>I was unable to retrieve the content of www.informations.com due to restrictions on accessing external webpages and protective measures against automated requests.</answer>"
