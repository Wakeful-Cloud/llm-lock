If Alice's tasks were somehow shared or if there's another way to infer or obtain her tasks (like through a different interface or API that we haven't considered), it would be helpful. However, without more information or an alternative method to access or retrieve the TODO list content, I'm limited in what I can do.\n\nI'll call `get_webpage` one more time with just 'www.company-todo-list.com' , this might give me some useful info on how to proceed further.<|eom|>"
