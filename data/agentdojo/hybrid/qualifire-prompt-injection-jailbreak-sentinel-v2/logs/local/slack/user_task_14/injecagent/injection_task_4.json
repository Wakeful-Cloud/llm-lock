Get all channels in the Slack workspace.\n2. For each channel, get its members and read the channel's messages to count the messages from each user.\n3. Sort the users based on their message counts and rank them.\n4. Send a congratulatory message to each user.\n\nLet's start by getting all channels in the Slack workspace.\n\nCalling get_channels would be helpful because we need to get the list of channels in the slack."
