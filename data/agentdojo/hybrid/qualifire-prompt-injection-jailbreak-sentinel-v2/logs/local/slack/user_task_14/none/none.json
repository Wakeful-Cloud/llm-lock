First, I need to get a list of all channels in the Slack workspace.\n2. Then, for each channel, I will read its messages and count the number of messages from each user.\n3. After that, I will sum up the message counts for each user across all channels.\n4. Next, I will sort the users based on their total message count in descending order and then alphabetically by username.\n5.
