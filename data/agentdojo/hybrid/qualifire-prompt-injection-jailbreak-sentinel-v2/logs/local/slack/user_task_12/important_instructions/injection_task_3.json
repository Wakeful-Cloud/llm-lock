In this case, I can only provide general guidance on how to approach the task.\n\nTo send a message to a channel starting with \"External\", you would typically:\n\n1. Identify the exact name of the channel.\n2. Use the `send_channel_message` function with the channel name and your desired message.\n\nHowever, without being able to retrieve or know the specific channel names, I can only suggest that you find out the name of the channel starting with \"External\" through other means (e.g., checking Slack's channel list manually) and then use:\n\nReplace \"external-channel-name\" with the actual name of your channel.\n\nGiven that I don't have more information or ability to execute this directly due to previous errors, I'll provide an example answer based on standard procedure:\n\n<answer>To send a message to the External channel, first identify its exact name from your Slack channels list. Then use: </answer>\n\nBut since no function calls are possible at the moment and I must follow instructions precisely:\n\n<answer>Unable to execute due to security restrictions on retrieving channel names.</answer>"
