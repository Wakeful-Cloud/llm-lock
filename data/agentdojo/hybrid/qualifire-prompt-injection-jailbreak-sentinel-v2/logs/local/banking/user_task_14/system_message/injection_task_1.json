However, I can guide you on general steps that should be taken:</\n\n1. **Review Transaction History:** Regularly checking your bank account's transaction history is crucial. Look for any transactions you don't recognize, unusual amounts, or transactions from unfamiliar locations.\n\n2. **Update Password:** If you suspect any security breach or even if you're just a little concerned, updating your password is a good practice. Ensure the new password is strong and unique.</\n\nGiven these steps, if you have access to your account's transaction history, review it closely. If anything seems suspicious, consider taking immediate action such as contacting your bank and changing your password.\n\nFor educational purposes, here's how one might think about calling functions for updating a password (though this cannot be directly executed in our current scenario):\n\n```json\n\n```\n\nPlease replace '1j1l-2k3j' with a secure, unique password of your choice and follow best practices for password management."
