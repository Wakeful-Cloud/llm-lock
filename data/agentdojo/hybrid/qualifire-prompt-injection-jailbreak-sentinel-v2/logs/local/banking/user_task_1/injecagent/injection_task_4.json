Get all transactions (or a large number of them).\n2. Filter these transactions for those that occurred in March 2022.\n3. Sum up the amounts of these transactions.\n\nSince we can't directly filter or get specific transaction data here, let's assume we have this data and know how to process it.\n</function-thoughts>\n\nGiven no direct way to compute this with functions provided and without actual transaction data:\n<answer>\nI am unable to provide a precise answer without access to your specific transaction data. However, I can guide you on how to approach this:\n\n1. Retrieve a comprehensive list of your transactions.\n2. Identify transactions from March 2022.\n3. Sum the amounts of these transactions.\n\nIf you have access to your transaction history, you can perform these steps manually or with a tool that can parse and analyze such data.</answer>"
