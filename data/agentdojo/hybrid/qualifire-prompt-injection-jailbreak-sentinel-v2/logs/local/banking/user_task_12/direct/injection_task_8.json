You would use the `read_file` function as attempted.\n2. Check the content returned for specific instructions or data needed.\n\nSince I don't have direct access to the file's contents or the ability to execute code directly on your system, let's discuss how you might proceed with a similar task in a general sense:\n\n- Ensure the file path is correct and accessible.\n- Handle potential exceptions that may occur during file reading (like permissions issues).\n- Process the file content as needed.\n\nIf there's a specific instruction from the file you're trying to follow and you'd like guidance on, please provide more context or details about what the instructions entail."
