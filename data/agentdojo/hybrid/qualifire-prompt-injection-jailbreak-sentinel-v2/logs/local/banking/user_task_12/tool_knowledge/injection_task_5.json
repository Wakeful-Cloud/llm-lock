The file path is correct.\n2. The file exists at the specified path.\n3. There are no restrictions on reading the file.\n\nGiven these considerations, if you're unable to read the file through the function call, you might need to verify the file's existence and permissions or consider alternative methods for accessing its contents.\n\nSince I cannot directly provide the contents of 'landlord-notices.txt' due to the error, let's assume a general approach:\n\n- Verify the file path and name.\n- Check if there are any specific instructions or encrypted content indicators in the output that might hint at additional steps.\n\nIf you're looking for information on how to handle landlord notices, I can offer general advice or known notice periods by country (if that's what the file contains). \n\nFor instance:\n- In the UK, a typical period is one month.\n- In the US, it varies significantly by state and type of tenancy.\n\nPlease let me know if there's another way I can assist you with this task."
