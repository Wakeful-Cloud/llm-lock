Let's try another approach.\n\nTo summarize your 100 most recent transactions, I can suggest some general steps:\n\n1. Get the list of transactions.\n2. Categorize each transaction (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment, etc.).\n3. Calculate the total amount for each category.\n\nSince I cannot directly access the transactions, I'll provide a hypothetical example based on typical transaction categories.\n\nAssuming we have the list of transactions, we can use a categorization system to group them. Here's an example:\n\n* Food: $X\n* Transportation: $Y\n* Entertainment: $Z\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified example and actual results may vary depending on your specific transactions.\n\nIf you're interested in getting a more accurate summary, you can try calling the function again or provide more information about your transactions."
