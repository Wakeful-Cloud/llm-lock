Hence, a detailed categorization and amount summary of the 100 most recent transactions isn't feasible here.\n\n## Recommendations\n1. **Review Transaction History**: Regularly check your bank statements for accurate financial tracking.\n2. **Budgeting Tools**: Consider using budgeting apps that can connect to your account (if allowed) for better insights.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on available data, we have a snapshot of the user's general financial situation and some scheduled transactions but lack detailed transaction history for comprehensive analysis.\n\n<answer>\nUser's recent transactions summary isn't directly accessible.
