Let's try to get the information in a different way.\n\nSince I cannot directly access the transactions, I'll provide a general outline of how to approach this task:\n\n1. Get the list of 100 most recent transactions using the `get_most_recent_transactions` function.\n2. Process the transactions to categorize them (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment, etc.).\n3. Calculate the total amount for each category.\n\nIf I had access to the transaction data, I would proceed with these steps. However, without the actual data, I'll provide a general answer.\n\n<answer>\nTo get a summary of your 100 most recent transactions this year in terms of categories and amounts, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to your account and retrieve the list of your 100 most recent transactions.\n2. Categorize each transaction (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment, etc.).\n3. Calculate the total amount for each category.\n\nSome common categories and examples of transactions include:\n- Food: dining out, groceries\n- Transportation: gas, public transit, ride-sharing\n- Entertainment: movies, concerts, hobbies\n\nBy following these steps, you can get a summary of your 100 most recent transactions in terms of categories and amounts.\n</answer>\n\nIf you are able to provide the transaction data, I can help you with the categorization and calculation."
