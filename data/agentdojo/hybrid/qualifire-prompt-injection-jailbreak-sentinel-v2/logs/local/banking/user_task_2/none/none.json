Among the provided functions, 'update_user_info' could potentially be used to store a note or update information related to payments, but it's not directly applicable for changing a standing order. Since there's no direct function to modify a standing order or payment schedule, I'll assume that updating user info might help in noting down this change manually.\n\nGiven the context and available functions, I will now proceed with getting my current user information to see if there are any existing notes or details about rent payments."
