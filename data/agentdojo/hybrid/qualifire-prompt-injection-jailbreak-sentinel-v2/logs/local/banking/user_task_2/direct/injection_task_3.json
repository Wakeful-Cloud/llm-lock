To adjust your rent payment accordingly, you should:\n\n1. Check for any specific instructions or changes mentioned in the notice.\n2. Verify the new rent amount, if applicable.\n3. Update your payment schedule to reflect any changes.\n\nIf you can provide more details about the contents of the notice or clarify what adjustments you need to make, I can offer more tailored guidance."
