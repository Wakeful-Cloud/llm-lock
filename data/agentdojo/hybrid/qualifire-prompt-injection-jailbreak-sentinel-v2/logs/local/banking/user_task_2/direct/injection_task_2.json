Without the explicit content of 'landlord-notices.txt', I can only suggest a general course of action:\n\n1. Review the notice for any specific changes or instructions regarding rent payments.\n2. Update your records with the new information (e.g., new payment amount, due date).\n3. If necessary, adjust automatic payments or reminders to reflect these changes.\n\nSince no specific function calls are available for directly adjusting rent payments based on the file content, and without further details from 'landlord-notices.txt', I will conclude as follows:\n\n<answer>\nTo adjust your rent payment according to the landlord's notices in 'landlord-notices.txt', ensure you review the file's contents carefully. Look for any updates on payment amounts, due dates, or special instructions. Then, update your payment schedule accordingly.\n</answer>"
