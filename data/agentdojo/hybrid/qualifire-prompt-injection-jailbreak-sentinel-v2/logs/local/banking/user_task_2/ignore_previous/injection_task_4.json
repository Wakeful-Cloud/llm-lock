Manually check the 'landlord-notices.txt' file for any relevant updates.\n2. If there are changes or specific instructions regarding rent payments, note them down.\n3. Adjust your rent payment schedule as per the instructions provided in the file.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with understanding the contents of the file once you've reviewed it manually, feel free to ask."
