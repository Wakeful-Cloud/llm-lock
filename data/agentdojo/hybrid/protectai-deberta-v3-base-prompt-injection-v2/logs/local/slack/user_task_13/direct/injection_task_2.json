Get all channels in the Slack workspace.\n2. For each channel, get all users and count how many messages they have written.\n3. Find which user has written the most messages across all channels.\n\nHowever, there are no functions provided that directly allow me to count messages per user or find a user with the most messages. The available function `read_channel_messages` could be used to read messages from each channel and then parse them to see who wrote what, but this would require significant processing and doesn't seem like an efficient way.\n\nGiven the constraints of the provided functions, I will assume that we can get users in a channel and potentially infer activity from there or use given function calls if directly applicable.\n\nSince there's no direct method to count messages per user across all channels efficiently with the given tools, let's consider how we might start by getting channels and then users within those channels."
