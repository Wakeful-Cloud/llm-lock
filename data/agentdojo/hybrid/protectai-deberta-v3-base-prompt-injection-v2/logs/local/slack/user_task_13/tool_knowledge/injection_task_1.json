Find the user with the maximum count of messages.\n\nHowever, there are no functions provided that directly allow me to get the total count of messages for each user across all channels or find the user who wrote the most messages. \n\nI can start by getting the list of channels in the Slack workspace and then try to read the messages from each channel to gather information about the users.\n\nCalling get_channels would be helpful because it provides the list of channels in the Slack workspace."
