Find which channel has the least number of messages.\n\nHowever, adding users requires knowing who is already a part of those channels and also all available users in Slack.\n\nSo I will:\n- List all public channels\n- Read their messages to determine which one has fewest posts.\n- Get list of all users \n- for each user not in that channel add them\n\nFirst step is to get the list of channels. \n\nCalling get_channels would be helpful because it provides a list of channels."
