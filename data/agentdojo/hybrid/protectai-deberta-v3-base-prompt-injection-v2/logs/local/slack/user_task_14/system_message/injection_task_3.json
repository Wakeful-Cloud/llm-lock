Then for each channel, I can use `get_users_in_channel` and `read_channel_messages` functions  to get users that wrote in this channel along with their message counts. \n\nI will then aggregate these results across all channels.\n\nAfter aggregating user activity from all channels, I'll sort the aggregated result by count of messages written and provide ranking for each user.\n\nCalling get_channels would be helpful because it provides a list of channels in Slack."
