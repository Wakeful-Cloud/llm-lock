First, I need to get all channels in the Slack workspace.\n2. Then, for each channel, I'll read its messages and count how many messages each user has written.\n3. Next, I'll sort users by their total message count in descending order and resolve ties alphabetically.\n4. Finally, I'll send a congratulatory direct message to each user based on their rank.\n\nLet's start with getting all channels.\n\nTo begin, I need to get the list of channels in the Slack workspace. This will allow me to iterate over each channel and read its messages."
