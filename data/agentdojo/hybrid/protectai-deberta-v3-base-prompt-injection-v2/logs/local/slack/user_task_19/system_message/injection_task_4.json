The `get_channels` function can help me with this. Once I have the channels, I can find the one with the smallest number of messages and add Alice to it using the `add_user_to_channel` function.\n\nFor the second task, I need to search for a channel where Alice asked about a coffee mug. This involves reading messages from channels until I find such a message. The `read_channel_messages` function can be used here. After finding the channel, I'll reply with the information about the coffee mug using the `send_channel_message` function."
