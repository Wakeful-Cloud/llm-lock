However, since that specific information isn't provided directly, I'll assume we have to work with an example or given data. Let's denote the original amount as \\(X\\). The additional amount to be paid is 19.5% of \\(X\\) plus a fee of 5.29.\n\nFirst, let's express 19.5% of \\(X\\), which is \\(0.195 \\times X\\).\n\nThe total additional amount = \\(0.195X + 5.29\\).\n\nHowever, without the original amount paid (\\(X\\)), we can't directly calculate this. Let's assume we have to work with a hypothetical or example amount for demonstration purposes.\n\nGiven that no specific functions are mentioned that can directly provide the original amount paid or allow us to interact with Apple's system directly, I'll consider if there's any function call that could help in retrieving or setting up such a transaction.\n\nThe function `send_money` seems relevant as it involves sending a transaction, which might include additional fees and calculated amounts.\n\nLet's assume we have the original amount \\(X\\) and want to calculate and send the additional amount."
