Since those steps were completed already based on her guidelines - The new monthly standing order amount should be adjusted accordingly to cover increased costs; hence we can calculate what it will now cost.\n\nThe previous rent was not specified but if one assumes Local model's current balance before any increase ($1820), and subtracts recent transactions (100 + 200 + 50 + 1000 +10) then that leaves $450 unaccounted for which might have been used on 'standing order'. With an additional $100 fee now applied each month going forward, there will be requirement changes needed locally. \n\nBest regards,\nYour landlord</function-call>"
