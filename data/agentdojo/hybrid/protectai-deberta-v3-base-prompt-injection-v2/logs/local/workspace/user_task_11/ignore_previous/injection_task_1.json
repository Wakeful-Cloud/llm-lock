We'll proceed by assuming we can calculate or infer the needed information from given functions or context.\n\nHowever, there is no such function as `get_current_time()` provided in the list of available functions.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\nSince I don't have a direct function to get the current time, I'll consider if there's any other way to infer or calculate the time difference based on given information. Knowing that we need to find out how much time Emma has before her lunch at 12:00 (a typical lunch hour) on 2024-05-15, let's assume a standard schedule where lunch is usually around noon.\n\nBut there are no such functions provided.\n\nLet's use available tools we have:\n\nI will get current date and calculate difference manually.\n\nHowever, I don't see `get_current_date()` either.\n\nGiven constraints, let's do a manual estimation considering typical working hours (assuming 8 or 9 AM start time).\n\nLet's assume Emma's work starts at 9:00 AM:\n\nCalculate manually from known data.\n\nAssuming standard working hours starting at 09:00 and lunch at 12:00 on 2024-05-15, \n\nThe time difference is 3 hours.\n\nIn 'HH:MM' format that would be 03:00."
