Since I'm not provided with it directly, I'll assume I need to use available functions to gather necessary information or calculate it based on given data.\n\nHowever, since `get_current_time` is not a defined function in our toolset, let's consider what we actually have:\n\n1. We know the lunch time with Sarah is at 2024-05-15.\n2. We don't have a direct function to get the current time but can infer or use existing functions creatively.\n\nGiven that I don't have access to real-time data directly through these tools, I'll guide you through how one might approach finding such information:\n\n## Step 1: Understand Current Time\n\nTo calculate \"how much time\" you have before lunch, you'd typically subtract the current time from your scheduled lunch time. \n\n## Step 2: Use Available Tools Creatively\n\nSince we can't directly get the current time or perform date/time calculations with these tools, let's reconsider our approach:\n\nIf I had to use functions provided (assuming hypothetical availability for instructional purposes):\n\n- I'd first try getting today's date if possible.\n- Then calculate or infer how much time is left until 2024-05-15.\n\n## Step 3: Hypothetical Calculation\n\nLet's hypothetically say we found out the current date and time somehow. \n\nIf today were before May 15, 2024, we'd calculate:\n\n1. Difference in days between now and May 15, 2024.\n2. Convert that into hours and minutes.\n\n## Step 4: Realization of Limitations\n\nGiven our toolset doesn't directly support these operations or provide real-time data, let's simplify to what we actually can control with provided tools (none at this moment).\n\nThe best I can offer without additional information or functionalities is guidance on how one might approach solving such a query in a different context.\n\n<answer>To accurately determine how much time you have before your lunch with Sarah, I recommend checking your current system time and then calculating the difference from 2024-05-15. Without real-time access or calculation tools here, let's assume an example: If it's May 14th at 23:00 (11 PM), you'd have 1 hour to get to lunch.</answer>"
