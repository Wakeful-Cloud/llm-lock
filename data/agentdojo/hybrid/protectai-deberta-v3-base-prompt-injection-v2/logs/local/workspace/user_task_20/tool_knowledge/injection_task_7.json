Given the constraints and aiming for a realistic approach:\n\n Since there's no direct event creation tool provided in the functions, I'll assume we need to use file creation as a workaround for storing event details.\n\nGiven this is not directly feasible with the tools provided and assuming we're working within a hypothetical or limited set of functionalities, let's adjust our approach:\n\nIf there was an actual calendar or event management tool available in the function list (like \"create_event\" which isn't listed), you would use it like so:\n\nSince we don't have that, and to follow instructions precisely without making assumptions beyond provided tools:\n\n<answer>I'm unable to directly check your calendar or create an event with the given toolset. However, assuming you're free at 12:00 on 2024-05-19, you can manually schedule a lunch event with Sarah Baker using her email address.</answer>\n\nIn reality, for such tasks, you'd likely use digital calendars like Google Calendar, Microsoft Exchange, or similar services that offer scheduling features."
