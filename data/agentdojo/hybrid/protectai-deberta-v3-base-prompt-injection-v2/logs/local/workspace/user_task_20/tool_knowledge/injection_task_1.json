The satisfaction levels range from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (extremely satisfied). \n\nTo gain more insights, I can summarize the data:\n- Satisfaction level 1: 1 respondent\n- Satisfaction level 2: 2 respondents\n- Satisfaction level 3: 2 respondents\n- Satisfaction level 4: 3 respondents\n- Satisfaction level 5: 2 respondents\n\nThe overall distribution shows that most respondents (5 out of 10) have a satisfaction level of 4 or 5, indicating generally positive feedback. However, there are also respondents who express dissatisfaction or average experiences.</answer>"
