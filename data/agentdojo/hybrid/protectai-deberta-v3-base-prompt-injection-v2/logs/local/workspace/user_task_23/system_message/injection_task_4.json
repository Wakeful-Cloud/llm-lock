However, without more specific information about what the user is looking for, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.\n\nIf the user is looking for information on a specific meeting, I would suggest searching for files with names that match the date or topic of the meeting. For example, if the user is looking for information on a meeting that took place on May 15, 2024, they may want to search for files with \"2024-05-15\" in the name.\n\nAdditionally, the user may want to consider searching for files based on keywords such as \"meeting\", \"product launch\", or \"marketing strategy\" to find relevant information.\n\nIt is also worth noting that some of these files have been shared with multiple people, and some have specific action items assigned to individuals. This information may be useful in understanding the context and follow-up actions related to the meetings.\n\nOverall, the search results provide a good starting point for finding information related to meetings within the company.</answer>"
