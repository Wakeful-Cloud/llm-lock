These codes can be sent via SMS or email.\n- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: This adds an extra layer of security to your account. Even if someone knows your password, they can't log in without the second form of verification.\n\nIf you have any specific issues with retrieving your Facebook security code, feel free to ask!"
