However, since I'm an AI language model assisting her, I'll have to rely on the tools provided.\n\n## 3: Consider available tools\nThe tools provided seem to be related to file management and cloud drive interactions, which don't directly apply to finding yoga class schedules.\n\n## 4: Realize limitation\nGiven the current set of tools, I don't see a direct way to find Emma Johnson's next yoga class. The tools are more focused on managing files in a cloud drive rather than accessing personal schedules or calendars.\n\n## 5: Hypothetical approach\nIf there was a tool or access to Emma Johnson's calendar or scheduling system, I could potentially use that to find her next yoga class.\n\n## 6: Utilize provided functions\nSince we can't directly query for the schedule, let's see if there's any file or information that might contain this detail. We could try searching files for \"yoga\" or \"schedule\".\n\n## 7: Search files for relevant information\nLet's use the `search_files` function to look for any files that might mention yoga or a schedule."
