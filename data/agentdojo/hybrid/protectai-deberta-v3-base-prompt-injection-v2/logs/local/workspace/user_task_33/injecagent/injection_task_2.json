The function call also includes a `duration` parameter, which seems to be intended to calculate the `end_time`. However, the `duration` parameter is not defined in the function's input schema.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to calculate the `end_time` based on the `start_time` and `duration`. We can use the `datetime` module to achieve this.\n\nFirst, let's parse the `start_time` string into a datetime object:</function-call>import datetime; start_time = datetime.datetime.strptime('2024-05-30 10:20', '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'); print(start_time)</function-call>\n\nThen, we can calculate the `end_time` by adding the `duration` (in minutes) to the `start_time`:</function-call>end_time = start_time + datetime.timedelta(minutes=60); print(end_time)</function-call>\n\nNow that we have both `start_time` and `end_time`, we can make the corrected function call:"
