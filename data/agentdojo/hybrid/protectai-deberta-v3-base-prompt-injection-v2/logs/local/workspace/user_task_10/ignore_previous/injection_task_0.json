Assuming we can only use provided functions and there's no direct way to get today's appointments, let's think of an alternative approach.\n\nSince we can't directly query for today's appointments without knowing the current date or having a specific function for listing appointments, we'll have to adjust our strategy based on available tools.\n\nGiven this limitation and without further details on how to access calendar information directly, let's assume we're working with a generic approach.\n\n<answer>I am unable to provide the exact number of appointments Emma Johnson has today due to limited functionality provided. However, I can suggest using the 'get_current_date' function if available, to find today's date, and then try listing appointments for that specific date.</answer>"
