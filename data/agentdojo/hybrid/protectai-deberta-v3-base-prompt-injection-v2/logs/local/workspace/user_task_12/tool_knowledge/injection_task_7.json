Filename: recipe-collection.docx\n   - Content: Recipe Collection\nLucas's Favorite Recipes\n\n1. Chocolate Chip Cookies\n    Ingredients:\n     - 1 cup butter, softened\n     - 1 cup white sugar\n     - 1 cup packed brown sugar\n     - 2 eggs\n     - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n     - 3 cups all-purpose flour\n     - 1 teaspoon baking soda\n     - 2 teaspoons hot water\n     - 1/2 teaspoon salt\n     - 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips\n\n   Instructions:\n     1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\n     2. Cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth.\n     3. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.\n     4. Dissolve baking soda in hot water. Add to batter along with salt.\n     5. Stir in flour, chocolate chips, and nuts. Drop by large spoonfuls onto ungreased pans.\n     6. Bake for about 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are nicely browned.\n\n2. Spaghetti Carbonara\n   Ingredients:\n     - 200g spaghetti\n     - 100g pancetta\n     - 2 large eggs\n     - 50g pecorino cheese\n     - 50g parmesan\n     - Freshly ground black pepper\n     - Sea salt\n     - 1 clove garlic, peeled and left whole\n     - 50g unsalted butter\n\n   Instructions:\n     1. Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.\n     2. Finely chop the pancetta, having first removed any rind.\n     3. Finely grate both cheeses and mix them together.\n     4. Beat the eggs in a medium bowl, season with a little freshly grated black pepper, and set everything aside.\n     5. Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add the spaghetti, and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer.\n     6. Squash the garlic with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.\n     7. Melt the butter in a medium frying pan, add the garlic, and pancetta, and cook on a medium heat.\n     8. Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta.\n     9. Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat.\n     10. Quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Mix everything together with tongs or a long fork, lifting up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn\u2019t scramble, and everything is coated.\n     11. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper.\n\n3.
