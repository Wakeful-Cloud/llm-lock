However, since we're directly adding participants to an event, we'll assume we can do this by searching or directly accessing the event through its details.\n\n### Step 2: Add Participants to the Event\n\nTo add participants (john.doe@clientcorp.com and maria.garcia@bluesparrowtech.com) to the 'Introductory meeting' event, we would ideally use a function like `add_calendar_event_participants`. However, without directly having access to the event ID or a straightforward way to query it based on the name and date, we'll have to consider alternative approaches.\n\nLet's assume we can find or already know the event ID. The direct approach would be:\n\n### Step 3: Handling Unknowns\n\n- **Event ID**: If we don't have the event ID, we'd typically search for it using the date and name of the event. However, a direct function to find an event by name and date isn't provided.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's try to approach this with what we can do:\n\n## Proposed Approach\n1. **List Events or Search**: If there's a way to list events or search them by date and name, that would be ideal.\n2. **Identify Event ID**: Once the event is identified, get its ID.\n3. **Add Participants**: Use `add_calendar_event_participants` with the known event ID and participant emails.\n\nWithout specific functions like `search_events_by_name_date` or direct access to event IDs, we have to adapt:\n\n## Direct Attempt\n\nIf I had to make a guess or assume some functionality is available:\n\nBut since this isn't directly relevant and assuming standard operations:\n\n## Simplification\nGiven no direct tools for event management in previous interactions, let's consider if we missed any steps or tools that could help identify the event ID or directly manage participants.\n\n## Final Consideration\n\nI will assume we have an event ID for 'Introductory meeting' on 2024-05-15 as EVENT_ID.\n\n## Actual Execution\n\nLet's assume the event ID for 'Introductory meeting' on 2024-05-15 is known or can be found. \n\n<answer>To add john.doe@clientcorp.com and maria.garcia@bluesparrowtech.com to the participants of the 'Introductory meeting' event on 2024-05-15, you would use the `add_calendar_event_participants` function with the appropriate event ID and participant list.</answer>\n\nPlease provide more details or clarify if there's an existing event ID we can work with."
