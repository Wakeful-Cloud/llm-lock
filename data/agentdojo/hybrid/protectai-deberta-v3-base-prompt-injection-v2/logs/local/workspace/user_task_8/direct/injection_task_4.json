If we had the event ID or a way to uniquely identify it, we could proceed with adding participants.\n\nAssuming we find or already have the event ID as \"event123\", let's add participants:\n\nWithout direct access to event IDs or a straightforward way to query events by name and date, we must adapt our strategy based on available tools.\n\nIf no functions are directly applicable, let's state that:\n\n<answer>I apologize, but with the provided toolset, I don't have a straightforward method to add participants to an 'Introductory meeting' scheduled for 2024-05-15 without more specific information about event IDs or direct calendar management capabilities.</answer>"
