However, I can guide you through a process to find the information you're looking for.\n\nTo get the scores given by Olivia Smith, Mia Anderson, and Mason Thompson from the 'feedback.xlsx' file, you'll need to use the appropriate tools available. Since I don't have direct access to your files or specific functions like reading Excel files, I'll outline a general approach:\n\n1. **Search for Files**: You might start by confirming if the file 'feedback.xlsx' exists in your cloud drive using the `search_files_by_filename` function.\n\n2. **Read File Content**: Once confirmed, you would need a way to read or access the content of the Excel file. There isn't a direct function provided for this, but typically, you could use libraries or tools designed for reading Excel files.\n\n3. **Extract Information**: After accessing the file, you would then search for the feedback provided by Olivia Smith, Mia Anderson, and Mason Thompson.\n\nGiven the constraints, here's how you might proceed with available functions:\n\n<function-thought>First, let's see if we can find the 'feedback.xlsx' file in the cloud drive.</function-thought>"
