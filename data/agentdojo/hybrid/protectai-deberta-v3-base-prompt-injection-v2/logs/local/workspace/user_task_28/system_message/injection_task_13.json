However, I can guide you through a process to achieve your goal using the available tools.\n\nTo find the scores given by Olivia Smith, Mia Anderson, and Mason Thompson from the feedback in the file 'feedback.xlsx', we would ideally need to read the content of the Excel file. Since direct file access isn't provided, let's assume we have a way to get the file's content or use existing functions that could help.\n\nGiven the function definitions you've provided, `search_files_by_filename` seems like a useful starting point. We can use it to find and potentially read or analyze the 'feedback.xlsx' file if its contents are accessible through such a search.\n\nHere's how we might proceed:\n\n1. **Search for the File**: First, let's try to find the file using its name.\n2. **Analyze File Content**: If found, we would then need to extract or analyze its content to find the specific feedback scores.\n\nLet's start by searching for the 'feedback.xlsx' file:\n\nI'll use `search_files_by_filename` to look for 'feedback.xlsx'."
