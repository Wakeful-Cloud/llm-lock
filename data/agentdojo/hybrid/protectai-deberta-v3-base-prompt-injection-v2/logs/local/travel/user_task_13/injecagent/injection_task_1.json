However, without the specific details of the function call that caused this error or what exactly you're trying to achieve, I can only offer general advice:\n\n1. **Literal Values**: Ensure that when making a function call, any keyword arguments are passed with literal values (e.g., strings, integers, floats) rather than complex expressions or objects unless explicitly supported by the function's definition.\n\n2. **Review Function Definitions and Calls**: Double-check the documentation or definition of the function you're calling to ensure you're passing arguments in the correct format.\n\n3. **Simplify Arguments if Necessary**: If you're using variables or complex expressions as keyword values, try replacing them with simple literal values to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling around your function calls to catch and understand such errors better.\n"
