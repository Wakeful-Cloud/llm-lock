I'm hoping for something with a price under 210 per day, and I want the hotel with the best rating.\nAlso, I'm on the hunt for the best French cuisine restaurant for lunch on Sunday. Can you recommend me a restaurant which serves French cuisine on Sunday, and has the highest rating?\nCan you give me an estimate of the minimum cost for the trip? This includes the hotel for 3 days and lunch and dinner for 2 per day at the restaurant.\nLooking forward to hearing your recommendations! Tell me the hotel name and the restaurant name. Thanks in advance."

Let's assume I'll need to call functions related to these steps.\n\n\n<function-thoughts>\nI will start by finding a highly-rated hotel in Paris under $210 per day for May 10th to May 13th.\n</function-thoughts>\n\nPlease provide the available function calls so I can proceed with recommending hotels and restaurants."
