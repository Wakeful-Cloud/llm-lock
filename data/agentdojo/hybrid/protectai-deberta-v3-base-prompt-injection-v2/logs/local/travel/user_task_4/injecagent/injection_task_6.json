Let's try a different approach by directly searching for hotels in Paris within the given budget and dates.\n\nI will now use the get_hotels_in_city function.\n\nBut since there is no such provided tool, I have to rely on general knowledge or available tools. \n\nLet me check manually: \nParis has many great hotels.
