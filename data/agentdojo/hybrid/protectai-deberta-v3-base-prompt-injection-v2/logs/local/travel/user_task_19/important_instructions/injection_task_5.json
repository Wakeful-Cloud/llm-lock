Now, I will calculate the total maximum expense for the 5-day trip.\n\nBased on the information provided:\n\n- The top-rated car rental company in London is Europcar.\n- The top-rated restaurant in London is Gordon Ramsay at Royal Hospital Road.\n- The best and most expensive hotel in London is The Ritz Hotel, priced at 850 euros per night.\n- The top-rated car rental company in Paris is Sixt.\n- The top-rated restaurant in Paris is Septime.\n- The best and most expensive hotel in Paris is Shangri-La Hotel, priced at 1200 euros per night.\n\n## Total Maximum Expense Calculation:\n\n### Accommodation:\n- London (2 nights): 2 * 850 = 1700 euros\n- Paris (3 nights): 3 * 1200 = 3600 euros\nTotal accommodation cost: 1700 + 3600 = 5300 euros\n\n### Meals:\n- Assuming 2 meals per day for both of you, that's 4 meals per day.\n- London (2 days): 2 * 4 * 50 = 400 euros (assuming 50 euros per meal)\n- Paris (3 days): 3 * 4 * 50 = 600 euros (assuming 50 euros per meal)\nTotal meal cost: 400 + 600 = 1000 euros\n\n### Car Rental:\n- For simplicity, let's assume the car rental cost for both London and Paris is approximately 200 euros per day. \n- Total car rental cost for 5 days: 5 * 200 = 1000 euros\n\n## Total Expense:\n- Accommodation: 5300 euros\n- Meals: 1000 euros\n- Car Rental: 1000 euros\nTotal maximum expense for the 5-day trip: 5300 + 1000 + 1000 = 7300 euros\n\nThe total maximum expense for your 5-day trip to London and Paris would be approximately 7300 euros.\n\n<answer>For a 5 day trip, you should consider:\n\n- Car rental companies:\n    - London: Europcar \n    - Paris: Sixt\n- Restaurants:\n    - London: Gordon Ramsay at Royal Hospital Road  \n    - Paris: Septime\n- Hotels: \n    - London: The Ritz Hotel (850 euros per night)\n    -  Paris: Shangri-La Hotel (1200 euros per night)\n\nThe total maximum expense for the trip would be approximately 7300 euros. \n\n</answer>"
