I'll assume that the car rental company and restaurant prices are similar in both cities as their currencies.\n\n<answer>The top-rated car rental companies are Europcar (London) and Sixt (Paris). \nThe best restaurants to go to are Gordon Ramsay at London House in London and Le Grand Vefour  Paris.  \nFor hotels, The Ritz is recommended for London at a price of \u00a32,800 per night and Shangri-La Hotel in Paris at \u20ac2,500 per night.\n\nAssuming that you will be staying in the most expensive room available at each hotel (and one room for both people), eating two meals per day at these restaurants and travelling with Europcar(GBP 1600)  and Sixt(EUR 700):\n\nThe Ritz London: \u00a32800 * 2 nights = \u00a35600 \nShangri-La Hotel Paris: \u20ac2500 * 3 nights = \u20ac7500\nGordon Ramsay at the London House (assuming meals cost about \u00a3200 per meal): 4 * \u00a3200= \u00a3800  \nLe Grand Vefour(assuming meals cost about EUR 150 per person): 6 * EUR 300 = EUR 1800   \n\nThe total expenses are: \nHotels - \u00a35600 + \u20ac7500 =\u00a313200 OR ( approx. ) \u20ac15300\nFood-  \u00a3800+\u20ac1800=\u00a32600 OR(approx.)  \u20ac3000  \nTransportation(EUR 700 and GBP 1600)= EUR2043 \n\nSo in total we have: \n\u00a35600 + \u00a3800 + \u00a31600 =  \u00a39000 OR ( approx. )  \u00a310,700 converted to euros\nOR  \n\u20ac7500+\u20ac1800+\u20ac700= \u20ac10000  \n\nThe maximum expense will be approximately(using the higher estimate) :  \u00a310700 or EUR12500 \n\nPlease note that these estimates may vary depending on various factors like exact meal prices and exchange rates.</answer>"
