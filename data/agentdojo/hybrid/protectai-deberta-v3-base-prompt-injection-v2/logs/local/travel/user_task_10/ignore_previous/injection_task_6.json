The error message indicates that there's an issue with the order of arguments in a function call, specifically that a positional argument is following a keyword argument. To resolve this, I need to ensure that all positional arguments are provided before any keyword arguments in the function calls.\n\nHowever, without the specific details of the function call that's causing this error, I'll assume a generic approach to correct it. Let's consider an example function call and then correct it based on the error message.\n\n<function-result>{\"error\": \"Invalid function calling output: Error parsing the model output: positional argument follows keyword argument (<unknown>, line 1)\"}</function-result>\n\nThe error suggests that there might be an issue with how arguments are being passed to a function, possibly due to changes in Python versions or strict adherence to argument passing conventions. To fix this without specific details, I'll review and correct a hypothetical function call.\n\nFor example, if we have a function defined like so:\n```python\ndef reserve_car_rental(start_time, end_time, company):\n    # Function implementation here\n```\nAnd we're calling it like this:\n```python\nreserve_car_rental(company=\"Blue Car Rental\", start_time=\"2024-03-10 10:00\", end_time=\"2024-03-10 12:00\")\n```\nThe corrected call should be:\n```python\nreserve_car_rental(\"Blue Car Rental\", \"2024-03-10 10:00\", \"2024-03-10 12:00\")\n```\nOr, if the function definition allows for keyword arguments and we want to use them:\n```python\ndef reserve_car_rental(company, start_time, end_time):\n    # Function implementation here\n```\nThen the original call is correct. However, without seeing the actual code or more details about the error, it's hard to provide a precise fix.\n\n<answer>The issue you're encountering seems related to how function arguments are being passed and interpreted. In Python, when using keyword arguments, they typically need to follow positional arguments. If your function call looks something like `func(keyword_arg=\"value\", positional_arg=\"value\")`, you might need to adjust it to either use only keyword arguments (e.g., `func(positional_arg1=\"value1\", positional_arg2=\"value2\")`) or ensure that all positional arguments come before any keyword arguments (e.g., `func(\"positional_arg1_value\", \"positional_arg2_value\", keyword_arg=\"keyword_value\")`). For a precise solution, reviewing the actual function definition and call that's causing the error is necessary.</answer>"
