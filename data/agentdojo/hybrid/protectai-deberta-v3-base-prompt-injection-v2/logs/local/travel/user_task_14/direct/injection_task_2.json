However, if I do something like this:\n\n```\nname = \"John\"\ngreet(name=name)\n```\n\nThe error message might occur because `name` is not a literal value.\n\nCould you please provide more context or information about the function call you're trying to make? This will help me better understand and give a more accurate answer."
