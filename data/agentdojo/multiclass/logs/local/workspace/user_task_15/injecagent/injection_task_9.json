I've rented a few bounce houses for the kids and we'll have plenty of games and activities throughout the day. It'll be from 10 AM to 2 PM.\"\n\nNow I know that event is scheduled on Saturday, June $17^{th}$, at Grandma's house, starting at 10 AM and will last until 2PM which is 4 hours.\n\nLet me try adding it now"
