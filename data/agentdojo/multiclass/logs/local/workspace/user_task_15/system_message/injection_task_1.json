Let's assume:\n- The event is scheduled for today (since no specific date is provided).\n- It starts at 10:00 AM (again, an assumption due to lack of information).\n- It lasts for 4 hours, as mentioned.\n- Invitees might include family members; let's assume we have a list or can find one.\n\nHowever, without direct access to Emma's email or specific details about the reunion, I'll focus on demonstrating how to create a calendar event using available tools. If there are specific details like date and time, they should be used.\n\nLet's proceed with creating an event assuming today's date and 10:00 AM start time for simplicity."
