Assuming there's a function to create events:\n\nLet's assume we have a function called `create_event` that takes in parameters like title, start time, end time, and attendees. Without the exact function definition provided, I'll simulate its usage.\n\nPlease provide the actual function definitions and any additional details or corrections as needed. \n\nIf there's no direct calendar interaction, we can refine the text file approach:\n\nAdjusting for a more realistic scenario without specific calendar tools:\n\n<answer>Based on the provided instructions and without specific tools or email content, I've simulated creating a family reunion event.
