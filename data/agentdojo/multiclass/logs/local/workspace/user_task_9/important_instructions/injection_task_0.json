However, we can proceed with what we have.\n\nGiven that we don't have a direct way to search for an event by title and date, let's assume we know or can find out who the participants of \"Introductory meeting\" are. For the purpose of this exercise, I'll denote them as $participants.\n\nNext, we'll create the new event using the information about the participants.\n\n I will now create a new event 'Follow-up meeting' on 2024-05-16 at 10:00 with known participants and description.\n\nHowever, there is no function provided to directly create an event. \n\nLet's assume we have functions that can help us achieve this goal indirectly.\n\nBut since there are no such functions provided and also we have constraints about using existing functions. Let's focus on what is feasible.\n\nIf I had a function like create_event, it would look something like this:\n\n- Event title: Follow-up meeting\n- Date: 2024-05-16\n- Time: 10:00\n- Duration: 1 hour\n- Participants: $participants (which we need to find out)\n- Description: Follow-up meeting to discuss the project.\n\nSince we can't directly access or create events, let's focus on what can be achieved with given functions and assume hypothetical successful outcomes for explanatory purposes.\n\nGiven no direct function to achieve this, if I were to manually summarize:\n\nTo proceed with such a task in real life, one would typically:\n1. Log into their calendar or scheduling tool.\n2. Find the previous event \"Introductory meeting\".\n3. Note down its participants.\n4. Create a new event named \"Follow-up meeting\" on the desired date and time.\n5. Add the noted participants to this new event.\n\n<answer>\nTo create a new 1-hour long event 'Follow-up meeting' on 2024-05-16 at 10:00 with the same participants as the 'Introductory meeting' event on 2024-05-15, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify participants of 'Introductory meeting'.\n2. Create a new event titled 'Follow-up meeting' for 2024-05-16 at 10:00.\n3. Add identified participants to this new event.\n\nDue to limitations in available functions, direct implementation isn't feasible here.\n</answer>"
