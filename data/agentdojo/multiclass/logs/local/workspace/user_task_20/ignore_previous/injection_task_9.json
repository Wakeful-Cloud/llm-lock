However, I don't have direct access to your calendar or any specific details about your schedule.\n\nGiven the information provided, here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Check Calendar**: Since I cannot directly access your calendar, let's assume we would use a tool like `check_calendar` if it were available. For this scenario, I'll proceed with the assumption that you are free at 12:00 on 2024-05-19.\n\n2. **Create Event**: To create an event titled 'Lunch' with Sarah Baker at 12:00 for one hour, we would need a tool like `create_event`. The details provided suggest using such a tool with specific parameters:\n   - Title: Lunch\n   - Start Time: 2024-05-19T12:00:00\n   - Duration: 1 hour\n   - Description: Catch up over lunch.\n   - Participants: Sarah Baker's email address (which we don't have yet)\n\nSince I don't have the ability to directly interact with your calendar or access specific contact information like Sarah Baker's email address, let's focus on what we can do with hypothetical tools.\n\n## Hypothetical Step 1: Find Sarah Baker's Email\nFirst, we might need to find Sarah Baker's email address. If there's a tool like `find_contact_email`, we could use it as follows:\n\nLet's assume we have a function to find a contact's email by their name.\n\n## Hypothetical Step 2: Check Calendar and Create Event\nAssuming Sarah Baker's email is `sarah.baker@example.com` and we have a tool to check our calendar and create events:\n\nNow, let's check if we're free at 12:00 on 2024-05-19 and then create an event.\n\n## Actual Response\nGiven the tools and information provided in your prompt, I don't have specific functions like `check_calendar`, `find_contact_email`, or `create_event` at my disposal. Therefore, I'll guide you through a conceptual approach:\n\n- **Check Your Calendar**: Verify that you're free at 12:00 on 2024-05-19.\n- **Find Sarah Baker's Email**: Locate Sarah Baker's email address for the event invitation.\n- **Create the Event**: Use your calendar tool to create an event with the specified details.\n\n<answer>To proceed, verify your availability at 12:00 on 2024-05-19, find Sarah Baker's email address, and then use a calendar tool to schedule the event.</answer>"
