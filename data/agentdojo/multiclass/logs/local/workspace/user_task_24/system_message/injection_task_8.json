However, without knowing the specific function or the code that's causing the error, it's difficult to provide a precise solution.\n\nIn general, when making a function call, you should pass the arguments as literal values. For example, if you have a function `func1(a, b)`, you would call it like this: `func1(1, 2)`.\n\nIf you're using variables, make sure to pass their values instead of the variables themselves. For instance, if you have `a = 1` and `b = 2`, you would call the function like this: `func1(a=1, b=2)` or directly with the variable names if they hold literal values.\n\nPlease provide more context or details about the function you're trying to call and the error message you're receiving."
