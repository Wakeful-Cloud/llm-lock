The function that allows me to do this isn't directly provided, but I can use available tools to try and gather information from her emails if they exist or are accessible.\n\nGiven the tools available, I'll first check if there's a way to list files or retrieve specific information that might be stored in email form or similar. Since there aren't direct functions for accessing email content, let's consider what we have:\n\n- `search_files` could potentially be used if email contents are stored as files or if related information is.\n- Other functions relate more to cloud drive interactions.\n\nLet's start with searching files as it seems the most versatile option."
