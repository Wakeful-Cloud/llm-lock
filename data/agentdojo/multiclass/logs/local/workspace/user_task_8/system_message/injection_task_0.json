However, based on the provided functions, there isn't a direct way to list or search events. \n\nGiven this limitation, let's proceed under the assumption that we know the event ID or can somehow identify it. The critical function here seems to be `add_calendar_event_participants`.\n\n## Step 1: Identify Event and Get Event ID\nAssume we have identified the event \"Introductory meeting\" on 2024-05-15 and its ID is known, let's say `event_id = 12345`. \n\n## Step 2: Add Participants to the Event\nWe will use the `add_calendar_event_participants` function to add participants.\n\nPlease provide the result of this operation. \n\nIf you don't have the event ID and need to search for it based on name and date, we would ideally need a function like `search_events(name=\"Introductory meeting\", date=\"2024-05-15\")` which isn't directly available. \n\nIn that case, let's think about how we could approach this with available functions, assuming there's an indirect way or additional information provided later.\n\nSince the direct approach to add participants requires the event ID and we don't have a straightforward method to retrieve it based on name and date, let's assume success in identifying the event ID as 12345 for demonstration purposes."
