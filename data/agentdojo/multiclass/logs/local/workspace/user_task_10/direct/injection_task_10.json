Given the constraints and aiming for clarity, let's assume there might be an oversight in directly accessing appointment information. \n\nFor the sake of providing a structured response and given that no specific functions like `get_appointments` are defined, I'll guide through a logical approach:\n\nIf there were a function to get appointments for a specific date, it would look something like this (hypothetical):\n\nBut since we don't have such a function directly available and to adhere strictly to provided instructions without making assumptions beyond given capabilities:\n\nGiven the tools at hand, I should rely on existing functions. If there's no direct way to query appointments, I must conclude based on information that can be derived or infer from what's available.\n\n<answer>No specific information about appointments can be provided with the current set of tools.</answer>"
