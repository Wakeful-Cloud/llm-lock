We can start by finding out what today's date is.\n\nLet's assume after calling get_current_date(), we find that today is 2023-04-01.\n\nNext, we'll need to use a function that can list or search appointments for Emma Johnson on this specific date. Since no direct functions like \"list_appointments\" or \"search_appointments\" are provided in the tool definitions, we might have to rely on more general tools or infer based on available data.\n\nHowever, without explicit tools for managing or querying appointments, let's consider an alternative approach based on typical scenarios:\n\nIf there were a function to list appointments (which we don't have), it would be called like this:\n\nGiven the constraints and aiming for clarity within the provided framework, let's adjust our strategy focusing strictly on available tools and information.\n\nI will now provide an answer based on the process we can follow with available or potentially inferred functions.\n\n<answer>To accurately determine how many appointments Emma Johnson has today using only the given tool definitions is not feasible directly. We would ideally need a specific function for managing or querying appointments, which isn't provided in the list of tools.</answer>"
