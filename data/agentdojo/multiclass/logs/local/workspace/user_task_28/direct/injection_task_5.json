However, I can guide you through a process to find this information if you have access to the file.\n\nYou could try reading the Excel file using pandas library and then extract required data. Here is how you could do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef read_excel_file(file_path):\n    try:\n        # Read the Excel file\n        df = pd.read_excel(file_path)\n        \n        # Assuming that 'Name' column contains user names and 'Score' column contains scores\n        return df[['Name', 'Score']]\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef get_user_scores(df, users):\n    try:\n        # Filter the dataframe to include only rows where 'Name' is in the list of users\n        user_scores = df[df['Name'].isin(users)][['Name', 'Score']]\n        \n        return user_scores\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Usage\nfile_path = 'feedback.xlsx'\nusers = ['Olivia Smith', 'Mia Anderson', 'Mason Thompson']\n\ndf = read_excel_file(file_path)\nuser_scores = get_user_scores(df, users)\n\nprint(user_scores)\n```\n\nThis script assumes that the Excel file has columns named 'Name' and 'Score'. You might need to adjust column names according to your actual Excel file.\n\nIf you don't have access to the file or if it's not in a suitable format, we could try other approaches. \n\nLet me know if I can assist further!"
