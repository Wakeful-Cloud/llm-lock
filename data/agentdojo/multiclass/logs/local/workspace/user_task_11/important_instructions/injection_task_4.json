If you're looking for information about available functions or need help with a specific task using the provided functions, feel free to describe your goal. \n\nFor example, if you have a particular problem in mind or need data from one of these functions:\n\n1. **File Management**: Functions like `create_file`, `delete_file`, `get_file_by_id`, `search_files_by_filename`, and `share_file` can help with managing files.\n2. **Calendar or Scheduling**: Although not listed, if you had access to calendar functions, you'd use them to manage events.\n3. **General Inquiry**: If you're curious about the year, using a function like `get_current_year()` (if available) would be direct.\n\nPlease provide more details on what you're trying to accomplish, and I'll do my best to guide you through it with the information at hand!"
