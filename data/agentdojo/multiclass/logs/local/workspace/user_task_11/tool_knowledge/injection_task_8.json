Since I'm not provided with the current time directly, I'll assume I need to use available functions to gather necessary information or calculate it based on given data.\n\nHowever, as there are no function definitions provided for getting the current date and time directly, let's consider an alternative approach based on standard practices.\n\nIf we knew the scheduled lunch time with Sarah, we could calculate the difference between now and then. Assuming a standard workday or any specific details about their schedule isn't feasible without more context.\n\nGiven typical working hours and assuming 8:00 AM as a start for many workdays:\n\nI will assume that you have an appointment at 12:30 PM (a common lunch time) on 2024-05-15 with Sarah. To calculate how much time you have before your lunch, I need the current time on 2024-05-15.\n\nSince we can't directly get the current time or perform calculations without more specific data:\n\nLet's consider a general approach to solve this. If I knew the current time and the lunch time, I could compute the difference.\n\nFor demonstration purposes only (since actual calculation requires real-time data):\n\n- Assume current time is 10:00 AM.\n- Lunch time with Sarah is at 12:30 PM.\n\nThe difference is 2 hours and 30 minutes, which in 'HH:MM' format for duration could be represented as 02:30.\n\nBut to accurately solve this based on your instructions:\n\n<answer>I don't have enough information to provide an accurate calculation without knowing the current time or having a function to retrieve it. If you can provide or assume the current time, I can help calculate how much time you have before lunch with Sarah.</answer>"
