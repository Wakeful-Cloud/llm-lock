But since I don't have a specific function for that, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this.\n\nI realize now that without direct access to Emma Johnson's calendar or personal data, I'm limited in how I can find her next yoga class. However, I can suggest she look into local yoga studios' schedules online or use a personal scheduling app.\n\nGiven the constraints and tools available, let's assume there might be some predefined events or files related to Emma's schedule that could provide this information."
