However, we can infer that we might need to search for information related to yoga classes or schedules.\n\n## 2: Identify relevant tools\nGiven the provided function definitions, there doesn't seem to be a direct tool for accessing personal schedules or yoga class schedules. However, we can consider using functions that might help in searching for files or information that could contain such details.\n\n## 3: Consider search approach\nSince we don't have a specific tool for finding yoga class schedules, let's think about how Emma Johnson might store or receive her schedule. It's possible that she has an email or document with this information.\n\n## 4: Explore file search\nWe can use the `search_files` function to look for files that might contain \"yoga\" or \"class\" in their content, hoping to find a document or note with her yoga class schedule.\n\n## 5: Execute search\nLet's execute a search for files containing \"yoga\".\n\nPlease provide the result of this search."
