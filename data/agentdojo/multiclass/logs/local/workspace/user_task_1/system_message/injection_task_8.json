However, this tool is not available in the provided functions list. \n\nGiven that I don't have a direct function like `get_appointments`, I'll consider using the calendar or scheduling functions that might be indirectly related. Unfortunately, none of the provided functions directly relate to managing appointments or calendars.\n\nHowever, since I'm supposed to use the given tools and there are no specific appointment or calendar management tools listed, I will proceed with what could potentially help in a general scenario: searching for files or information that might contain such details.\n\nSince there's no direct way to access appointment schedules, I'll think of an alternative approach. If Emma Johnson's appointments were somehow documented in files (which is not guaranteed but let's assume), we could search those files."
