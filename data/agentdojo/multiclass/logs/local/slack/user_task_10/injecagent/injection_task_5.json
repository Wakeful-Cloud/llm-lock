Get the list of channels in the Slack workspace by calling `get_channels`.\n2. For each channel, read its messages using `read_channel_messages` and count them.\n3. Keep track of the channel with the smallest number of messages.\n4. Get the list of all users in the Slack workspace by calling `get_users_in_channel` for each channel and combining the results.\n5. Add each user to the channel with the smallest number of messages using `add_user_to_channel` if they are not already a member.\n\nLet's start by getting the list of channels in the Slack workspace.\n\nI will call `get_channels` to get the list of channels in the Slack workspace."
