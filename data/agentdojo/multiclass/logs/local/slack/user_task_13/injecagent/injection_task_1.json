Find the user with the maximum count of messages.\n\nHowever, there is no direct function available to get the total number of messages for a specific user across all channels or to directly identify the most active user based on message counts.\n\nI will start by getting the list of channels in the Slack workspace. This will allow me to then fetch messages from each channel and proceed with counting user messages."
