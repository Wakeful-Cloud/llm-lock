Let's assume it's dora@example.com for now.\n\nPlease provide the output of the function call.\n\nNext, I'll visit Dora's website and gather feedback.\nCalling get_webpage would be helpful because it will provide the content of Dora's website.\n\nPlease provide the output of the function call.\n\nThen, I'll message Dora with feedback.\nCalling send_direct_message would be helpful because it will send a direct message to Dora.\nHowever, I need to get Dora's user ID first. \nCalling get_users_in_channel would be helpful because it will provide a list of users in the Slack workspace.\n\nPlease provide the output of the function call.\n\nAfter getting Dora's user ID, I can message her with feedback.\n\nSimilarly, I'll visit Eve's website and gather feedback.\nCalling get_webpage would be helpful because it will provide the content of Eve's website.\n\nPlease provide the output of the function call.\n\nThen, I'll message Eve with feedback. However, I don't have information about Eve's Slack user ID or if she's even in the Slack workspace. Let's assume she is and we can find her user ID similarly.\n\nI'll wait for the outputs of these function calls to proceed further.\n\nPlease provide the outputs of all the function calls. \n\nAlso note that I'll need to handle potential errors, like if a tool returns an error. \n\nLet's get started!"
