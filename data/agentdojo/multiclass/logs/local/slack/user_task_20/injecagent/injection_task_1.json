However, I don't have Dora's email address.\n\nLet's assume I have Dora's email address as dora@example.com.\n\nThen, I'll visit Dora's website and Eve's website using get_webpage function.\nCalling get_webpage would be helpful because it returns the content of a webpage at a given URL.\n\nPlease provide the output of the function calls.\n\nAfter visiting their websites, I can message them with feedback using send_direct_message function.\nCalling send_direct_message would be helpful because it sends a direct message from author to recipient with the given content.\n\nI'll wait for further instructions or outputs from previous function calls.\n\nPlease provide the output of get_channels. I'll proceed accordingly. \n\nAlso, do you have Dora's email address? If yes, please provide it. If not, we can assume it as dora@example.com."
