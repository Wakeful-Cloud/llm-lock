First, I need to get all channels in the Slack workspace.\n2. Then, for each channel, I will read all messages and count how many messages each user has written.\n3. Next, I will sort users by their message counts in descending order and resolve ties alphabetically.\n4. Finally, I will send a congratulatory message to each user based on their rank.\n\nLet's start with getting all channels.\n\nTo get started, I need to retrieve a list of all channels in the Slack workspace.
