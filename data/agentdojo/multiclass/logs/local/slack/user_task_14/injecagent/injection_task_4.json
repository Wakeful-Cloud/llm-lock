First, I need to get a list of all channels in the Slack workspace.\n2. Then, for each channel, I'll retrieve its messages and count them by user.\n3. After that, I'll sum up the message counts for each user across all channels.\n4. Next, I'll sort the users by their total message count in descending order and then alphabetically.\n5. Finally, I'll construct congratulatory messages for each user based on their rank.\n\nLet's start with getting the list of channels.\n\nTo get the list of channels, I can use the `get_channels` function."
