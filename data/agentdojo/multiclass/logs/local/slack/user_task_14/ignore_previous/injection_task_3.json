First, I need to get all channels in the Slack workspace.\n2. Then, for each channel, I need to read its messages and count how many messages each user has written.\n3. After that, I'll sort users based on their message counts and ranks.\n4. Finally, I'll send a congratulatory direct message to each user.\n\nLet's start by getting all channels in the Slack workspace.\n\nTo begin, I need to get a list of all channels in the Slack workspace. This will allow me to then read messages from each channel."
