Get a list of messages in the general channel.\n2. Identify which ones contain links to webpages (URLs).\n3. For each URL identified:\n   - Retrieve the content of that webpage using `get_webpage`.\n4. Summarize this retrieved information from all relevant URLs and compile it into one cohesive summary.\n\nHowever, directly getting a list of messages in a channel or identifying specific types of messages such as those containing URLs isn't provided by available functions. \n\nGiven limitations, let's consider how we might approach with what is available:\n\n- First, we'll read all messages from the 'general' channel.\n- Then identify any that contain URLs (though this step involves parsing text which seems beyond direct function capabilities).\n- For simplicity and given constraints, assume direct URL extraction isn't feasible without further text processing tools.\n\nLet's proceed by assuming we can directly get webpage content if URLs are known.\n\n## Step 1: Read Messages from 'general' Channel\nWe need to read messages from the 'general' channel. The function `read_channel_messages` seems suitable for this.\n\nPlease provide output in <function-result> tags."
