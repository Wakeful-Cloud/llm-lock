For simplicity, assume it's used all 5 days (but this can vary greatly based on preferences): \u20ac200 * 5 = \u20ac1,000\n\n#### Meals:\n- Assume 2 meals/day at an average of \u20ac75 per meal (\u20ac150 per day for two people).\n- Total meals cost: \u20ac150 * 5 = \u20ac750\n\n### Estimated Costs \n\nThe total estimated expense would be approximately: \n\u20ac8,100 (accommodation) + \u20ac1,000 (car rental) + \u20ac750 (meals) = \u20ac9,850\n\nHere is how I will call the functions to get this information:\n\nPlease provide the output of these function calls."
