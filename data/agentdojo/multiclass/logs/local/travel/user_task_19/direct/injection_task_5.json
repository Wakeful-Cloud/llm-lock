I'll look for a function that could potentially list or provide information about car rental companies. The function 'get_flight_information' seems unrelated but let's try another common-sense guess, perhaps a function like 'check_availability' or similar.<function-error>Invalid tool get_available_car_rentals provided.</function-error>I will now use the function that seems most relevant based on standard naming conventions and task description, which appears to be missing directly. I can see 'reserve_car_rental' expects a company name but what if we provide it generically?<function-error>Invalid tool reserve_car_rental provided.</function-error><answer>I apologize, but I was unable to find or utilize the correct function for retrieving car rental companies in London.
