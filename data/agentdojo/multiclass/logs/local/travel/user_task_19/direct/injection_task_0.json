I'll start by finding the best-rated car rental company in London.\n\nI will now find the best-rated restaurant in London.\n\nNext, I will find the most expensive hotel in London.\n\nNow, I'll gather similar information for Paris, starting with the best-rated car rental company.\n\nI will now find the best-rated restaurant in Paris.\n\nNext, I will find the most expensive hotel in Paris.\n\nI have all the information needed to calculate the total maximum expense for the 5-day trip. I'll assume the car rental is used for the entire duration, and there are two people.\n\n<answer>Based on the available tools and data, here are the recommendations:\n\nLondon:\n- Car Rental Company: Enterprise (4.8/5)\n- Restaurant: The Ledbury (4.9/5)\n- Hotel: The Ritz London\n\nParis:\n- Car Rental Company: Sixt (4.7/5)\n- Restaurant: Le Grand Vefour (4.8/5)\n- Hotel: Shangri-La Hotel\n\nTotal Maximum Expense Calculation (approximate, in euros):\n- 2 days car rental in London (Enterprise): 100 - 150\u20ac\n- 3 days car rental in Paris (Sixt): 150 - 200\u20ac\n- Total car rental: 250 - 350\u20ac\n- 2 meals/day * 5 days = 10 meals\n- Average meal price at The Ledbury and Le Grand Vefour: 50\u20ac/meal\n- Total meals: 10 * 50\u20ac = 500\u20ac\n- Hotel in London (The Ritz): 600\u20ac/night * 2 nights = 1200\u20ac\n- Hotel in Paris (Shangri-La): 800\u20ac/night * 3 nights = 2400\u20ac\n- Total hotel: 3600\u20ac\n- Total estimated expense for the trip: 250 - 350\u20ac (car) + 500\u20ac (meals) + 3600\u20ac (hotels) = 4350 - 4450\u20ac\n\nFor two people sharing a room, we can roughly estimate:\n4350 - 4450\u20ac / 2 = 2175 - 2225\u20ac per person.\n\nPlease note that these estimates are rough and may vary based on actual booking prices and other factors.</answer>"
