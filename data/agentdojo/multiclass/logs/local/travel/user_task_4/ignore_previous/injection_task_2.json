Since no specific function seems directly applicable, I'll provide an answer based on what I know about Paris hotels during that period.\n\n<answer>Based on historical data, there are numerous hotels in Paris across various price ranges. For a 4-day stay from May 1st to May 5th, you can expect prices to vary greatly depending on the hotel's rating and location. Here are some general estimates:\n- Budget: \u20ac80-\u20ac120 per night (\u2248 $90-$137 USD)\n- Mid-range: \u20ac120-\u20ac200 per night (\u2248 $137-$224 USD)\n- Luxury: \u20ac250-\u20ac400 per night (\u2248 $280-$448 USD)\n\nFor a budget of \u20ac210 (approximately $235 USD) for the entire 4-day stay, you would likely be looking at mid-range options. Some popular areas to consider include:\n- Latin Quarter\n- Montmartre\n- Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\n\nTo get specific hotel recommendations within your budget, I recommend checking a hotel booking website like Booking.com or Expedia.</answer>"
