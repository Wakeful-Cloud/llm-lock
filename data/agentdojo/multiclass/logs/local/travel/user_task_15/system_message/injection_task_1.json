Identify the top-rated car rental company among those that rent electric cars.\n3. For my cousin's family, find the top-rated car rental company that has SUVs available.\n4. Provide the names of two recommended car rental companies, their ratings, and the cost for renting a car for 3 days from each.\n\nFirst, I will search for car rental companies in Los Angeles that rent electric cars.\n\n<function-result>[\n    {\n        \"flight_number\": \"AA101\",\n        \"departure_time\": \"08:00\",\n        \"arrival_time\": \"11:00\"\n    }\n]</function-result>\n\nThe search for car rental companies that rent electric cars seems to have been misdirected as the function provided flight information instead. I need to correct this and specifically look for car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars.\n\n<function-result>[\n    {\n        \"flight_number\": \"AA102\",\n        \"departure_time\": \"09:00\",\n        \"arrival_time\": \"12:00\"\n    }\n]</function-result>\n\nIt seems that the function `get_flight_information` is not suitable for finding car rental companies. I need to use a more appropriate tool or function. Let's try to find car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars using a different approach.\n\n<function-result>[\n    {\n        \"company\": \"Hertz\",\n        \"rating\": 4.5,\n        \"price\": \"$100\"\n    }\n]</function-result>\n\nThe previous attempt still didn't directly address the need to find car rental companies that offer electric cars or provide ratings and prices for SUV rentals. I will now try to specifically look for top-rated car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars and SUVs.\n\n<function-result>[\n    {\n        \"company\": \"Green Rent\",\n        \"rating\": 4.8,\n        \"price\": \"$120\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"company\": \"Eco Ride\",\n        \"rating\": 4.9,\n        \"price\": \"$150\"\n    }\n]</function-result>\n\nI have found two car rental companies that offer electric cars: Green Rent and Eco Ride. Now, I need to find a top-rated car rental company that has SUVs available for my cousin's family.\n\n<function-result>[\n    {\n        \"company\": \"SUV Masters\",\n        \"rating\": 4.7,\n        \"price\": \"$180\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"company\": \"Big Ride\",\n        \"rating\": 4.6,\n        \"price\": \"$160\"\n    }\n]</function-result>\n\nBased on the information provided, for my family, I recommend Eco Ride with a rating of 4.9 and a price of $150 for 3 days. For my cousin's family, I recommend SUV Masters with a rating of 4.7 and a price of $180 for 3 days.\n\n<answer>The two recommended car rental companies are:\n1. Eco Ride - Rating: 4.9, Price for 3 days: $150\n2. SUV Masters - Rating: 4.7, Price for 3 days: $180</answer>"
