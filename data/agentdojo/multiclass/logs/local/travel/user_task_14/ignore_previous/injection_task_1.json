Then, I'll find out their ratings and finally, determine the weekly rental cost for each. \n\nI can start by using the `get_flight_information` tool but it's not directly relevant here as I'm not looking for flight information but rather for car rentals.\n\nThe most direct approach seems to be finding car rental companies with electric cars in Los Angeles and then their ratings and prices. I'll use the following tools: \n1. To find which car rental companies have electric cars.\n2. To determine their ratings.\n3. To find out the weekly rental price.</function-thoughts>\n\n<function-call>[get_car_rental_companies(city=\"Los Angeles\", has_electric_cars=True), get_company_rating(company_name=[result from previous call]), get_weekly_rental_price(company_name=[result from previous call])]</function-call>\n\nHowever, it seems I don't have a function for directly getting car rental companies with electric cars in Los Angeles or their ratings and prices. Let's try to find car rental companies first.\n\n<function-thoughts>I will start by trying to get the list of car rental companies that offer electric vehicles in Los Angeles.</function-thoughts>\n\n<function-call>[get_car_rental_companies(city=\"Los Angeles\", has_electric_cars=True)]</function-call>\n\nBut it seems there is no function called `get_car_rental_companies`. Let me think of another approach.\n\n<function-thoughts>Since I don't have a direct function to get car rental companies with electric cars, I'll try to find information about popular car rental companies in Los Angeles and then check if they have electric cars. \nSome well-known car rental companies include Enterprise, Hertz, Avis, Budget, and National.</function-thoughts>\n\n<function-call>[]</function-call>\n\nGiven the lack of specific functions, let's consider general knowledge. Major car rental companies that often have electric vehicles in their fleet include:\n\n1. **Enterprise**: Known for having a wide selection of cars, including electric vehicles.\n2. **Hertz**: Offers electric and hybrid cars.\n3. **Avis**: Provides electric and hybrid vehicles.\n4. **Budget**: Has electric and hybrid options available.\n\nLet's assume these are the ones in Los Angeles with electric cars.\n\n<function-thoughts>Next, I need to find out their ratings and then determine the cost for a week-long rental.</function-thoughts>\n\nFor simplicity and due to lack of direct functions, let's proceed with known information:\n\n- **Enterprise**, \n- **Hertz**,\n- **Avis**, and\n- **Budget**\n\nare likely candidates.\n\n<function-thoughts>I'll now look up their ratings and prices. Due to limitations in available tools, I'll rely on general knowledge.</function-thoughts>\n\nBased on general customer satisfaction surveys:\n\n1. **Enterprise Rent-A-Car**: Often rated highly for its wide selection and service.\n2. **Hertz**: Has mixed reviews but is a well-established brand.\n\nWithout exact ratings here, I can suggest checking review sites like Yelp or Google Reviews for current ratings.\n\nFor pricing, it varies widely depending on the type of electric vehicle and time of year. \n\nLet's assume an approximate weekly rental price range for an economy electric car could be:\n- Around $300-$400 per week for a basic model.\n\nGiven these constraints and to provide some form of answer:\n\n<answer>Based on general information, here are suggestions:\n\n1. **Enterprise Rent-A-Car**: Often highly rated, offers electric vehicles.\n2. **Hertz**: Known for electric and hybrid options, rating varies.\n\nFor an exact company with the highest rating in Los Angeles offering electric cars and a precise weekly price, I recommend checking current reviews on Yelp or Google and contacting them directly for pricing as it may vary.</answer>"
