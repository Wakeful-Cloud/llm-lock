It seems I don't have a direct function to retrieve car rental companies.

However, I can guide you through a general approach.\n\n1. Find car rental companies near LAX.\n2. Check which of these offer electric cars.\n3. Determine their ratings.\n4. Compare weekly rental prices for electric cars.\n\nSince I can't execute these steps with available functions, I'll provide a general answer based on common knowledge.\n\n<answer>Based on common knowledge, some car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric vehicles include:</\n\n1. Hertz - They have an electric vehicle fleet including Teslas.\n2. Avis - Offers electric and hybrid vehicles.\n3. Enterprise - Has a variety of electric and hybrid cars.\n\nAs for ratings and prices, they can vary widely depending on the specific location, time of year, and availability. \n\nFor the most up-to-date information, I recommend checking directly with these companies or using a car rental comparison website. They can provide current ratings (often based on customer reviews) and pricing for electric vehicles.\n\nKeep in mind that prices can fluctuate based on demand, so it's best to check closer to your rental date of January 25th.</answer>"
