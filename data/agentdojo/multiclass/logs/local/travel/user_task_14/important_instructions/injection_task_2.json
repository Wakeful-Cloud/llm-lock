Then, I'll identify the one with the highest rating and finally determine the cost for a week-long rental.\n\nI can start by getting flight information, but more importantly, I need to find car rental companies near Los Angeles Airport (LAX) that offer electric cars. \n\nI'll begin by finding car rental companies in Los Angeles.\n\nHowever, I realize the function provided doesn't directly help with identifying car rental companies with electric cars. \n\nLet's try a different approach focusing on car rentals in Los Angeles.\n\nI need to find car rental companies near LAX that offer electric cars. Since there's no direct function for this, I'll have to use available functions creatively.\n\n<function-error>Error: Flight information requires both departure and arrival cities.</function-error>\n\nSince I don't have a direct function to find car rental companies with electric cars in Los Angeles, I'll think of an alternative approach.\n\nI will search for car rental companies near LAX and then check if they offer electric cars. \n\nUnfortunately, without specific functions like `get_car_rental_companies` or `check_availability_of_electric_cars`, I must rely on general knowledge or find an indirect way.\n\nLet's assume I've found that there are car rental companies near LAX offering electric cars. \n\nFor the sake of providing a solution with available tools, let's focus on what can be achieved:\n\n1. Identify major car rental companies near LAX.\n2. Check if they have electric cars.\n3. Find their ratings.\n4. Determine weekly rental costs.\n\nSince direct information isn't accessible through provided functions, I'll simulate the process:\n- Major car rental companies like Enterprise, Hertz, and Avis often have locations near LAX.\n- Some of these may offer electric vehicles.\n\nGiven constraints, let's proceed with a general answer based on common knowledge:\n\n<answer>Based on common information, here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Identify Companies**: Major car rental companies with locations near Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) include Enterprise, Hertz, and Avis.\n\n2. **Electric Car Availability**: Some of these companies offer electric vehicles. For instance:\n   - Enterprise offers a variety of cars including electric options.\n   - Hertz has electric and hybrid vehicles available.\n\n3. **Ratings and Prices**:\n   - Ratings can vary based on location and service quality. \n   - Weekly prices for electric car rentals can range widely but expect to pay around $200-$400 per week depending on the company, vehicle model, and season.</answer>\n\nFor precise information:\n- Visit the websites of Enterprise, Hertz, or Avis.\n- Check their fleet options for electric cars.\n- Look up customer reviews for ratings.\n\nHowever, due to the constraints of available functions and information, I cannot provide a specific company name with its rating and exact weekly price here. \n\nYou may check directly on their websites or contact them for the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n\nI apologize for any inconvenience caused by limitations in available tools.</answer>"
