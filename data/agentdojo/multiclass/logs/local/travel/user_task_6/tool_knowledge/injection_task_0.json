If you would like, I can suggest some popular hotels in London or provide general tips for finding affordable accommodations.\n\nSome popular hotels in London include:\n\n* The Ritz London\n* The Savoy Hotel\n* The Langham London\n\nYou can also consider using online travel agencies such as Expedia, Booking.com, or Airbnb to find a wide range of options that fit your budget. Additionally, you may want to look into alternative accommodations such as hostels or guesthouses, which can often be more affordable than traditional hotels.\n\nI hope this information is helpful!
