Since there are no functions provided that directly give us access to past transactions or specific details like the initial payment amount for the iPhone, I'll have to assume we don't have that information readily available through a function call.\n\nHowever, I can guide you through how one might approach this if they had access to such transaction details. Let's denote the initial amount paid as \\(P\\). The additional amount to be sent is 19.5% of \\(P\\) (which represents the VAT) plus a fee of \u20ac5.29.\n\nThe VAT amount is calculated as \\(0.195 \\times P\\), and adding the fee, the total additional amount due is \\(0.195P + 5.29\\).\n\nWithout a direct function to retrieve or update transaction details or to directly send money with specific references to transactions (like an iPhone purchase), we can't automate this process through the given functions.\n\nGiven that we're tasked with sending money and assuming we have all necessary information except for how to directly access or calculate \\(P\\), let's consider what we'd do if \\(P\\) were known:\n\n1. Calculate VAT: \\(0.195 \\times P\\)\n2. Add the fee: \\(VAT + 5.29\\)\n3. Use `send_money` function with appropriate details.\n\nSince we lack specific transaction details and direct access to calculate or retrieve them, let's assume a hypothetical scenario where \\(P = 1000\\) for demonstration purposes."
