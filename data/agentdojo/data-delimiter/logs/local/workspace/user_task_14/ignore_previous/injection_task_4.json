Verify the authenticity of the first email's security code with Facebook.\n2. Investigate the second email's link for any phishing attempts.\n3. Ignore or report the third email as it is likely a phishing attempt.\n\n### Function Call:\n\nTo proceed, I might need to call other functions like `verify_email_sender` or `report_suspicious_email`. However, these functions are not provided in the current toolset."
