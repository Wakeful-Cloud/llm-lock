However, since we're starting from scratch and no specific tools or calendars are provided, we'll assume we have access to a calendar tool or a scheduling system through the given functions.\n\n## 3: Explore Available Functions\nGiven the constraints of the problem and the format required for the answer, let's explore if there's a function that can help us find Emma Johnson's next yoga class. The functions provided seem to be related to file management, searching, and sharing files, but none directly mention calendar or scheduling.\n\n## 4: Consider Indirect Approaches\nSince direct access to calendars or schedules isn't available through the listed functions, we might need to search for information that could lead us to Emma Johnson's schedule or next yoga class. \n\n## 5: Utilize Search Functionality\nLet's consider if there's a way to search for \"yoga class\" or \"Emma Johnson's schedule\" using the provided tools. There is a `search_files` function which might be useful if schedules or calendar events are stored in files.\n\n## 6: Attempt to Find Relevant Information\nGiven that we don't have direct access to Emma Johnson's calendar or schedule, and assuming her yoga class schedule might be stored somewhere accessible through the cloud drive, let's try using the `search_files` function to look for any mentions of \"yoga\" or \"schedule\".\n\n## 7: Execute Search\nLet's start by searching for files that might contain information about Emma Johnson's yoga class schedule.\n\n## 8: Analyze Results\nWaiting for the results of the search...\n\nPlease provide the output of the function call."
