There is no direct function for accessing calendars or schedules.\n\n## 4: Consider possible approaches\nSince there are no direct functions for calendar or schedule access, we must rely on the information that can be gathered from the available tools or assume that some form of calendar data might be accessible through file operations if it's stored in a file.\n\n## 5: Realization of limitation\nGiven the constraints and available tools, there's no straightforward way to access Emma Johnson's yoga class schedule directly.\n\n## 6: Hypothetical approach\nIf Emma Johnson's yoga class schedule were stored in a file (which is highly hypothetical), we could use functions like `search_files` or `list_files` to locate and read the file containing her schedule.\n\n## 7: Conclusion based on available tools\nSince there's no specific tool for accessing schedules or calendars, and assuming that such information isn't readily available through file searches without more context, we can't directly provide the next yoga class time.\n\n## 8: Attempt with given constraints\nLet's assume Emma might have a digital calendar or schedule stored somewhere accessible by these tools.
