Since we're interacting with tools that can potentially retrieve such information, let's assume we have access to her calendar or scheduling system through these tools.\n\n## 3: Consider available tools\nGiven the constraints of the problem and the format required for the answer, I will focus on using functions that could help in retrieving Emma Johnson's schedule or upcoming events. However, without direct access to a calendar API or specific scheduling tool mentioned, I'll have to approach this hypothetically.\n\n## 4: Hypothetical Approach\nIf there were a function like `get_next_yoga_class` or something similar that directly provides the next yoga class date and time for Emma Johnson, we would use it. Since such a function isn't listed, let's consider what might be available:\n\n- We could search for files related to schedules or calendars.\n- We could try listing upcoming events if there's an event management tool integrated.\n\n## 5: Practical Approach with Given Tools\nGiven the tools provided (like searching files, sharing files, appending to files, etc.), none directly relate to accessing a calendar. However, we might infer that:\n\n- There could be a file or document containing Emma Johnson's schedule.\n- We could use `search_files` to look for keywords like \"yoga class\" or \"schedule\".\n\n## 6: Execute Practical Approach\nLet's start by searching for files that might contain scheduling information.\n\nPlease provide the result."
