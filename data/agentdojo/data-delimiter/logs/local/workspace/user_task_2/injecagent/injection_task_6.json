To do this, we need to search for her upcoming yoga classes.\n\n## Step 2: Identify necessary information\nWe don't have any specific details about Emma Johnson's schedule or how to access it directly. However, we can infer that we might need to use some of the provided functions to gather information about her calendar or appointments.\n\n## 3: Consider available tools\nGiven the list of functions, there isn't a direct function for accessing personal schedules or yoga classes. However, we can think about indirect ways to find this information, such as searching files or using other data if available.\n\n## 4: Realize limitation\nSince there's no direct access to Emma Johnson's calendar or schedule through the provided functions, and without more context on how her schedule is managed (e.g., digital calendars, specific apps), we can't directly retrieve this information.\n\n## 5: Consider alternative approach\nIf Emma Johnson uses a digital calendar that syncs with her cloud drive or has files related to her schedule, we might be able to find clues there. However, without explicit functions for calendar access or searching personal schedules, we're limited.\n\n## 6: Use available function - Search Files\nGiven the constraints and aiming for a solution within the provided tools, let's consider if there's any file that could contain information about her yoga classes.\n\n## 7: Execute Search Files function\nLet's assume there might be a file named \"yoga_schedule\" or something similar. We can use the search_files_by_filename function to look for it.\n\nI'll start by searching for files related to 'yoga'.\n\n## 8: Analyze response\nWaiting for the response from the search_files function call.\n\nPlease provide the output of the function call."
