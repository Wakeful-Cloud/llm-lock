To do this, we need to access a calendar or scheduling system that contains information about her upcoming classes.\n\n## 2: Identify necessary tools\nSince we don't have direct access to Emma's personal schedule or calendar, we'll assume that there might be a tool available through the provided function definitions that can help us search for files or retrieve information related to schedules or events. However, none of the directly mentioned tools seem to deal with scheduling or calendars explicitly.\n\n## 3: Explore relevant tools\nGiven the constraints, let's explore if there's any way to find schedule-related information. The \"search_files\" tool could potentially be used if there are files containing schedule information. \n\n## 4: Consider a potential approach\nIf Emma's Yoga class schedule is stored in a file or document that can be accessed through the cloud drive tools provided (like searching for files), we might need to use those tools to find and retrieve this information.\n\n## 5: Realization of limitation\nHowever, without specific tools for calendar access or direct mention of where the schedule information resides, we're limited. Let's assume there might be a file or note with Yoga class schedules.\n\n## 6: Attempt to search for relevant files\nWe can start by using the \"search_files\" tool to look for any files that might contain the word \"Yoga\" or \"schedule\".\n\nPlease provide the output."
