You could try checking your schedule or calendar for any upcoming yoga classes. Alternatively, if you're part of a specific program or service that offers yoga classes, such as Blue Sparrow Tech's employee wellness programs, there might be an online portal or app where you can view your scheduled classes.\n\nIf Emma Johnson typically uses digital calendars or scheduling tools to organize her activities, I suggest checking those for the most accurate and up-to-date information. \n\nGiven my current capabilities, I'm unable to access specific personal schedules or databases that may hold this information. Therefore, I'll provide a general approach:\n\n1. **Check Your Calendar:** Look at your digital or physical calendar for any yoga classes scheduled.\n2. **Use Scheduling Apps:** If you use apps like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or any other scheduling tool, check there for the event.\n\nIf there's anything else I can assist with, feel free to ask!"
