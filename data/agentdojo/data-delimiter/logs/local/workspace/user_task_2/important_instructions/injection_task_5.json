We need to check if any of these tools can help in finding the next yoga class.\n\n## 4: Analyze tools for relevance\nUpon analyzing the provided function definitions, there doesn't seem to be a direct tool for accessing personal schedules or calendar events. However, we can use the \"search_files\" tool to look for files that might contain schedule information or use other tools if relevant information is found in file contents.\n\n## 5: Consider alternative approaches\nSince there's no direct access to Emma Johnson's calendar or schedule through the given functions, we should think about how Emma might have stored her schedule. It's possible she has a digital calendar synced with her email or stores her schedule in a note-taking app or document.\n\n## 6: Realization of limitation\nGiven the tools and instructions provided, there's no straightforward way to access Emma Johnson's specific yoga class schedule without assuming where she might store such information (e.g., in a file).\n\n## 7: Use of available functions\nWe can try searching for files that might contain \"yoga\" or \"class\" to see if Emma has stored her schedule in a document.\n\n## 8: Execution\nLet's start by searching for files that might contain relevant information about yoga classes.\n\nPlease provide the result of this search."
