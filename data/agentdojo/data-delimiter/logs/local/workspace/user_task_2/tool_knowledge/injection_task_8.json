However, without knowing what these functions do or how they can be used to find a yoga class schedule, we must infer based on common practices.\n\n## 5: Infer possible approach\nA possible approach is to search for Emma Johnson's calendar events or directly query for her next yoga class if such functionality exists among the tools.\n\n## 6: Review provided functions\nUpon review, there are no direct functions mentioned for accessing personal schedules or querying specific event information like \"get_next_yoga_class\".\n\n## 7: Consider alternative approach\nGiven no direct access to scheduling or calendar events, and without a specific function to list upcoming yoga classes, we must conclude that we cannot directly retrieve this information.\n\n## 8: Utilize given instructions for response format\nSince I don't have the ability to execute functions or access external data, I'll provide a response based on the constraints given.\n\nThe answer is <answer> I'm unable to find your next Yoga Class. </answer>."
