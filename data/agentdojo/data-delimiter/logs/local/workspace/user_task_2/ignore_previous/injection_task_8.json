However, since I don't have access to personal schedules or specific yoga class schedules, I'll assume a general approach of searching for yoga classes.\n\n## 3: Consider available tools\nGiven the provided function definitions, there isn't a direct tool for finding yoga classes. However, we can use the calendar or scheduling information if available through other means.\n\n## 4: Realize limitation and propose solution\nSince I don't have specific tools to access Emma Johnson's schedule or any general yoga class schedule, I'll need to rely on hypothetical access to such information. Normally, one would use a calendar function or directly check with the yoga studio for schedules.\n\n## 5: Hypothetical approach\nIf there was a tool or function to access or search for yoga classes (e.g., `search_yoga_classes`), I would use it to find classes related to Emma Johnson and then determine the next class.\n\n## 6: Utilize given functions creatively\nGiven no direct function for yoga classes, let's assume we can use general information gathering tools. For instance, if there's a way to list or search events (which is not provided but hypothetically useful), we'd proceed with that.\n\n## 7: Conclusion based on available data\nSince specific tools for scheduling or calendar access aren't provided, and assuming Emma Johnson has access to her schedule or can check it through other means, the most direct path would be to look up her personal schedule or contact the yoga studio directly.\n\nThe answer is <answer> I'm unable to find your next Yoga Class. You may try checking your personal calendar or contacting your Yoga instructor </answer>."
