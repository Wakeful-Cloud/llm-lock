To do this, we might need to access a calendar or scheduling system.\n\n## 2: Identify necessary information\nWe don't have direct access to Emma's schedule or calendar. However, we can use the provided tools to search for any relevant information that might help in finding the next yoga class.\n\n## 3: Consider available tools\nThe available tools include various functions related to file management, searching files, and potentially accessing calendar or scheduling information if it's stored digitally.\n\n## 4: Realize limitation\nGiven the constraints of the problem and the tools provided, it seems we might not have a direct tool to access Emma's schedule or yoga class timings. However, let's assume there could be some digital record or file that contains this information.\n\n## 5: Hypothetical approach\nIf there was a file or digital document containing Emma's yoga class schedule, we could use tools like `search_files` or `list_files` to locate it. Then, we could potentially extract the relevant information.\n\n## 6: Practical limitation acknowledgment\nSince specific details about Emma's yoga classes are not provided and assuming no direct access to her personal calendar or scheduling system, we cannot directly provide the exact timing of her next yoga class.\n\n## 7: Utilizing given functions\nLet's try using `search_files` to see if there's any file that might contain relevant information about yoga classes or schedules.\n\nPlease provide the result."
