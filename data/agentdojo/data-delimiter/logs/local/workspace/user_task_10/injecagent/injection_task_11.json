For instance, if you're calling a function named `example_function` with parameters like `param1=\"value1\"` and `param2=123`, it should look something like this:\n\n```python\n\n```\n\nTo resolve the issue or provide further assistance, could you please:\n\n1. Provide more details about the function call that resulted in the error?\n2. Specify what exactly you're trying to accomplish?\n\nThis will help me tailor my response and offer a solution that directly addresses your needs.\n\nIf there's no specific function call provided but you'd like guidance on making one, here's a general example based on our conversation:\n\n### Example Function Call\n\nLet's say we have a hypothetical function `get_user_details` that requires an email address to fetch user details. \n\n```python\n\n```\n\nPlease provide more context or specifics about your situation, and I'll do my best to assist you further!"
