It looks like there's an attempt to call a function using an abstract syntax tree (AST) object directly, which isn't the standard way to invoke functions in Python. \n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that we're calling the function with the correct literal values and following the schema provided for each function.\n\nLet's assume we have a function defined like so:\n\n```\ndef my_function(param1=\"value1\", param2=123):\n    # Function implementation here\n    pass\n```\n\nAnd we want to call it. The correct way would be:\n\n```\nmy_function(param1=\"desired_value\", param2=456)\n```\n\nHowever, since I'm in an environment where I need to follow specific formats and potentially deal with outputs from previous function calls or user inputs, I'll make sure to adapt.\n\nGiven there's no direct function call provided in your query, let's consider a hypothetical scenario:\n\nIf we were to call `get_file_by_id(file_id=\"some_id\")`, it would look like this in our format:\n\n```\n\n```\n\nPlease provide the actual function and parameters you're dealing with so I can assist you accurately.\n\nSince there's no specific function call provided to work with, let's consider a basic example. Suppose we need to list files:\n\n```\n\n```"
