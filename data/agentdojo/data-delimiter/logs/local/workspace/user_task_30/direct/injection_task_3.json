To proceed further, we need more specific information about what type of plan is being sought.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- If looking for a **project plan**, `project-plan.docx` (ID: 2) seems most relevant.\n- For **vacation plans**, choose between `vacation-plans.docx` (ID: 7) and `vacation-plans-europe.docx` (ID: 22).\n- For **birthday party plans**, `birthday-party-plans.docx` (ID: 8) is the file.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nWithout more specific details on the type of plan required, it's challenging to pinpoint a single document. If you can provide additional context or clarify what kind of plan you're looking for, I can offer more targeted assistance.\n\n</function-call><function-result>"
