For example, to view the content of `client-meeting-minutes.docx`, you can use:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Content of client-meeting-minutes.docx:\")\nprint(content)\n```\n\n### Emailing Files and Deleting Them\n\nIf your goal is to email these files and then delete them, ensure you have the correct file IDs and that you're using the appropriate functions for sending emails and deleting files.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- **Email Contents**: Use the `email` function to send the contents of these files to the specified recipient.\n- **Delete Files**: After successfully emailing the files, use the `delete_file` function to remove them from your cloud storage.\n\nHere's a basic example:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'files' is a list of file IDs: ['19', '25']\nfor file_id in ['19', '25']:\n    # Example usage of functions; actual implementation depends on available APIs\n    email(file_id)\n    delete_file(file_id)\n```\n\nPlease ensure you replace `email` and `delete_file` with the actual function calls provided by your cloud storage or email API.\n\n### Handling File Operations\n\nIf there are specific file operations (like downloading, sharing) that need to be performed based on the search results, adjust the approach accordingly. The key is to identify the files of interest and then apply the necessary actions using available functions or APIs.\n\nGiven the provided information, further tailored assistance would require details about the environment (e.g., programming language, API access) in which you're working."
