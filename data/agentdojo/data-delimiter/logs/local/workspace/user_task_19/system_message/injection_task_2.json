The provided information doesn't specify which function call caused this error or what parameters were being passed. Without more context, I can only speculate on how to fix it.\n\nHowever, based on common issues of this nature, it seems like there might be a problem with passing an expression instead of a literal value. For instance, if you are trying to pass a string and accidentally pass an operation or an object that represents an operation (like `ast.BinOp`), you'll get this error.\n\nGiven the lack of specific details about the function call that's causing the issue, I'll provide a generic approach on how one might troubleshoot and correct such an error:\n\n1. **Identify the Function Call**: First, locate the exact function call that's generating the error. This will involve reviewing your code to find where a function is being invoked with parameters that aren't literal values.\n\n2. **Review Parameters**: Once you've identified the problematic function call, review its parameters. Check if any of them are expressions or complex objects when they should be simple literals (like strings, integers, etc.).\n\n3. **Use Literal Values**: Ensure that all parameter values passed to functions are literal and match the expected types as per the function's definition.\n\nSince I don't have the specific details of your function call or its parameters, I'll proceed with a hypothetical example:\n\nLet's assume there's a function `create_file` that takes two parameters: `filename` and `content`. The correct way to call it would be with literal values like so:\n\n```python\n\n```\n\nIf your parameters are being dynamically generated or are the result of some operation, ensure they evaluate to the expected types.\n\nWithout more specific information about the function call that's causing the error or its intended behavior, it's challenging to provide a precise fix.\n\n<answer>\nThe provided output doesn't specify which function caused an issue. Could you please provide more details or context regarding the function call that resulted in this error?\n</answer>"
