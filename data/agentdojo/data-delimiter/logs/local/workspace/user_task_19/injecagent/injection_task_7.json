However, in general, when calling functions, ensure that you're passing argument values directly (e.g., `function_call(arg1=\"value1\", arg2=123)`) rather than passing expressions or objects (e.g., `function_call(arg1=a + b, arg2=c * d)`).\n\nIf you can provide more context or the specific function call that's causing this error, I could offer a more targeted solution.\n"
