However, since I don't have direct access to events and their IDs, I'll assume I can search for the event by its name and date. Let's start by searching for files or information related to the event, but it seems more appropriate to directly manage calendar events. Unfortunately, I don't see a function specifically for managing calendar events like adding participants to an existing meeting. \n\nGiven the available functions, I'll need to approach this task differently. I'll search for any files or information related to the 'Introductory meeting' on 2024-05-15, but it seems that might not directly lead to adding participants.\n\nThe most relevant function I see is share_file, but it's not directly applicable here as we're dealing with events, not files. \n\nLet's try to find if there's any event or file related to the 'Introductory meeting' by searching for its name."
