The available functions seem focused on file operations within a cloud drive, such as creating, deleting, sharing files, and searching content within those files. There are no explicit functions for email operations like listing or searching emails.\n\nIf you're looking to manage emails, typically you would use an email API or client that supports filtering unread emails. Without specific email-related functions in the provided toolset, I recommend exploring if there's an 'email' module or service integrated elsewhere that could offer such functionality."
