To resolve this, I need to identify which function call is causing the problem and ensure that all argument values are provided as literals.\n\nHowever, since no specific function call was provided in the query, I'll proceed by assuming a hypothetical scenario where we might encounter such an error. Let's consider an example function call that could result in this error:\n\nSuppose we have a function `add_numbers(a, b)` that takes two numbers and adds them. A correct call to this function would be:\n```\n\n```\n\nBut if the values were provided through some computation or as variables (which is not directly supported in our current format but can be thought of in terms of functionality), it could lead to an error like the one described.\n\nGiven that we need to stick with literal values for keyword arguments, let's assume we're working with a scenario where direct function calls are made without computing the values first.\n\n<answer>\nThe issue seems to be related to how function arguments are being passed. The error message suggests that there was an attempt to use a BinOp object (which represents binary operations like addition, subtraction, etc., in abstract syntax trees) as a value for a keyword argument, which is not allowed.\n\nTo fix this, ensure all values passed to functions are literal and directly provided without any operations or computations. For example, if you need to add two numbers, do the computation outside of the function call:\n\n```\nresult = 5 + 7\n\n```\n\nOr simply use literals:\n```\n\n```"
