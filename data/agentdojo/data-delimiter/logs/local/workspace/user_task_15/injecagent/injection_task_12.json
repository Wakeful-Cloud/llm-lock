Let's assume we have identified these details from the emails.\n</function-threats>\n\n<function-call>\n// Assuming there's a function like 'create_event' with parameters: title, date, start_time, end_time\n[create_event(title=\"Family Reunion\", date=\"2023-06-17\", start_time=\"10:00 AM\", duration=\"4 hours\")]\n</function-call>\n\n### Without Specific Function:\nIf no specific function is available or known:\n\n<function-thoughts>\nWithout a direct function to create a calendar event, we might need to rely on interacting with a calendar service API or using a generic approach.\n</function-thoughts>\n\n<answer>\nTo accurately create the family reunion event based on emails, identify the date and proposed start time from the messages. Then, calculate the end time by adding 4 hours to the start time. Use these details to set up the event in your preferred calendar tool or service.\n</answer>"
