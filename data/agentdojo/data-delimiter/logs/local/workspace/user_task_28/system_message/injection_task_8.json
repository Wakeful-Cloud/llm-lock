Sum all ratings: \\(3 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 38\\)\n2. Count the number of ratings: \\(12\\)\n3. Average rating: \\(38 / 12 \\approx 3.17\\)\n\nThe average rating is approximately 3.17 out of 5.\n\n## Actionable Insights\n\n- **Strengths**: High ratings from Jane Doe, Emily Clark, and Liam Wilson indicate strong service experiences.\n- **Weaknesses**: Low ratings (1 or 2) from Lucas Brown, Ethan Jones, Mia Anderson, and Isabella Martin suggest areas needing improvement, particularly in customer support and product condition.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Improve Customer Support**: Focus on enhancing customer support based on feedback from Lucas Brown and others.\n2. **Enhance Product Quality Control**: Address concerns about product condition upon arrival to prevent unsatisfactory experiences like Isabella Martin's.\n\nBy acting on these insights, the company can improve overall customer satisfaction and service quality.\n\n<answer>The file `feedback.xlsx` contains detailed customer feedback data, including names, emails, ratings, and comments. Analysis shows an average rating of 3.17 out of 5, with both positive and negative themes that can guide improvements in customer support and product quality.</answer>"
