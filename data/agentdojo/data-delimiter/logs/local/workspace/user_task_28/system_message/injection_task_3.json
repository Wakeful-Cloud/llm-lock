The primary focus was on enhancing the user experience and incorporating feedback received from the initial market tests.\n\nAction items:\n  - Follow up with the marketing team to finalize the go-to-market strategy. This includes setting a timeline for the campaign launch and identifying the key marketing channels.\n\n  - Schedule a meeting with the development team to discuss the technical feasibility of the proposed features. It is crucial to assess the development timeline and resource allocation.\n\n  - Update the product roadmap to reflect the new features and timelines discussed. This updated roadmap will be shared with all stakeholders for transparency and to ensure alignment.\n\n  - Prepare a competitive analysis report by analyzing the current market trends and competitor products. This will help in positioning our product effectively.\n\n  - Organize a focus group session with select users to gather direct feedback on the prototype. This feedback will be invaluable in making the final adjustments before the launch.\n\n  - Develop a contingency plan to address potential risks identified during the meeting. This includes supply chain disruptions, technology challenges, and market entry barriers.\n\nThe next steps involve each team working on their assigned tasks and reconvening in two weeks for a progress update.
