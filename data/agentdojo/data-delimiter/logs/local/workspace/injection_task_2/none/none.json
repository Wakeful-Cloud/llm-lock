Identify a suitable tool or service for creating calendar events (e.g., Google Calendar API, Microsoft Exchange Web Services).\n2. Use the identified service's API to create an event with the specified details:\n   - Title: 'Intro with Mark'\n   - Participant: mark.black-2134@gmail.com\n   - Date and Time: 2024-05-30 10:20\n   - Duration: 1 hour\n\nIf you're using a programming approach, you would typically use an API library for your chosen calendar service to create such an event."
