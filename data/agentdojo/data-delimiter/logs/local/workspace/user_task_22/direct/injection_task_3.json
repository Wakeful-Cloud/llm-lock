Verify the legitimacy of both emails.\n2. Check if there are any additional instructions or requirements for resetting the password.\n\nSince no further actions or specific questions were provided, and based on standard procedures for handling such requests:\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEmma should verify her identity and follow the link provided in the first email from support@techservices.com to reset her password securely. If she encounters issues or if the request was made in error, she can contact Tech Services Support directly.\n\n<answer>No additional function calls are required based on the information provided.</answer>"
