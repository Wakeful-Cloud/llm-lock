Since `get_current_time` is not available, we might consider alternative methods or tools that could offer similar functionality.\n\n\n## 3: Exploring Alternative Approaches\nGiven that we're interacting in a text-based environment and there's no direct method to fetch the current time, one approach could be to use a search tool if available, to find out the current year or any significant dates. However, without specific functions like `search` or access to external information, we rely on what's provided.\n\n\n## 4: Conclusion Based on Available Information\nSince we're unable to directly retrieve the current time through function calls and no alternative methods are specified for fetching such data, I will proceed based on standard practices:\n\n\nThe final answer is not determinable with the given tools."
