These platforms allow filtering by date, location, and price range, making it easier to find suitable accommodations.\n\nIf you're looking for recommendations or have specific preferences (like hotel rating, distance from landmarks, etc.), feel free to share, and I can try offering more tailored suggestions.</answer>"
