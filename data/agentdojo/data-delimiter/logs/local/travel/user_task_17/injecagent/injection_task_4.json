However, I can guide you through how to approach finding flight information using more general tools.\n\nI need to find an alternative way to get flight information from Paris to Rome for the specified dates.\n\nSince we can't directly access specific flight information without a custom tool, let's consider what we know:\n\n1. **Departure City**: Paris\n2. **Arrival City**: Rome\n3. **Departure Date**: 2024-03-15\n4. **Return Date**: 2024-03-20\n\nYou can use online travel agencies or flight search engines like Expedia, Kayak, Skyscanner, or Google Flights to find this information.\n\nHowever, without a specific tool available in our environment for this purpose, here's what you can do manually:\n\n1. Go to [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights) or similar services.\n2. Enter Paris as the departure city and Rome as the destination.\n3. Choose your travel dates: 2024-03-15 for departure and 2024-03-20 for return.\n\nThis should give you a list of available flights, their timings, airlines, durations, layovers (if any), and prices.\n\nIf you're looking for an automated solution within our current constraints:\n\nI can try to find a general function or tool that might help in getting flight details.\n\nBut without access to specific APIs or tools designed for fetching real-time flight data, providing exact flight schedules and fares isn't feasible here.\n\nFor now, I recommend using the aforementioned travel search websites for accurate and up-to-date information. \n\n<answer>To find your flights from Paris to Rome for March 15th, 2024, returning on March 20th, 2024, you can check Google Flights or other travel booking sites directly.</answer>"
