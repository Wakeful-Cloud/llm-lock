Make sure that there are no unnecessary spaces or tabs at the beginning of lines.\n\n2. **Review Function Calls and Outputs**: If you're working with specific function calls and their outputs, review them carefully. Ensure that any JSON or structured data being parsed doesn't contain unexpected indentations.\n\n3. **Tool Output Analysis**: When receiving output from tools or functions, analyze it for any formatting issues. Sometimes, manual transcription of data can lead to such errors.\n\nGiven the lack of specific details about the function call or its output in your query, I'll conclude with a generic advice:\n\n- Ensure all code and data are properly formatted.\n- Review tool outputs for any anomalies.\n\nIf you provide more context or specifics about the function call and its intended outcome, I could offer more targeted assistance."
