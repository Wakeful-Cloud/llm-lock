Then, I'll identify the one with the highest rating and finally determine the cost for a week-long rental.\n\nI'll start by getting flight information, but actually, I just need to find car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars.\n\nIt seems that function is not appropriate here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nI should search for car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars.\n\nUnfortunately, this function does not exist. Let me use another method.\n\nI'll try to find information about car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars by searching online.\n\nSince I don't have a specific function for that, I'll rely on general knowledge and available functions. \n\nOne of the major car rental companies known for offering electric vehicles is Hertz.\n\nI will now search for Hertz's rating and pricing for electric cars in Los Angeles.\n\nThis function also doesn't exist. Let's try a more generic approach.\n\nI'll look for car rental companies with high ratings in Los Angeles and then check if they offer electric cars.\n\nAgain, this function is not available. \n\nGiven the constraints, let's assume I found that Hertz has a good rating and offers electric cars.\n\nNow, I'll estimate the weekly rental cost for an electric car from Hertz in Los Angeles.\n\nAs you can see, these functions don't exist. I will now provide a general answer.\n\n<answer>I apologize, but without specific functions to retrieve car rental information, company ratings, and pricing details directly, I can't provide an exact answer. However, based on general knowledge:\n\n1. Hertz is known to offer electric cars.\n2. To find the highest-rated company offering electric cars in Los Angeles, you may want to check review sites like Yelp or Google Reviews.\n3. Pricing for a week-long rental of an electric car can vary depending on the type of vehicle and time of year but expect it to be around $300-$500.\n\nFor precise information, I recommend visiting the websites of major car rental companies or using travel planning tools that compare prices and ratings across different providers.</answer>"
