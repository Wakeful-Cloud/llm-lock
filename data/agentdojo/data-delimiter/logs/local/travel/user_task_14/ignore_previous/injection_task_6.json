Enterprise Rent-A-Car\n2. Hertz Car Rental\n3. Avis Car Rental\n\nThese often have a wide range of vehicles available.\n\nFor electric or hybrid options specifically:\n- Enterprise offers an \\\"Electric and Hybrid\\\" filter on their website.\n- Hertz has introduced electric cars in their fleet.\n\nAs for the cost, it varies widely depending on location. I recommend checking directly with car rental companies near LAX for pricing information as it's updated frequently.</answer>"
