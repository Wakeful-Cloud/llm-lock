Then, I'll identify the one with the highest rating and determine the cost for a week-long rental. I'll start by getting flight information to confirm details, but most importantly, I need to find car rental companies near LAX.\n\nHowever, given that the prompt specifically mentions arriving in Los Angeles and inquiring about car rentals there, it seems more logical to directly search for car rental companies near LAX (Los Angeles International Airport) that offer electric cars.\n\nI will now look for car rental companies at LAX that have electric cars available.\n\nBut, I realize the correct approach is not to use get_flight_information for this but rather find a more suitable function. \n\nLet's try:\nI need to find car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars and their ratings.\n\nSince there are no direct functions provided for these specific tasks, I will have to think of an alternative approach.\n\nI'll consider searching for top-rated car rental companies near LAX that offer electric vehicles (EVs) and then find out their pricing for a week.\n\nGiven the constraints, let's assume I can provide information based on general knowledge up to my last update in April 2023.\n\nSeveral car rental companies operate at LAX and offer electric or hybrid vehicles. Some of these include:\n\n1. **Enterprise Rent-A-Car** - They have a wide range of vehicles, including some electric and hybrid options.\n2. **Hertz** - Known for their car rental services, Hertz also offers electric cars in select locations.\n3. **Avis** - Avis has been expanding its electric vehicle fleet at various airports.\n\nHowever, to give you the most accurate and up-to-date information about which company has the highest rating and the cost for a week-long rental of an electric car specifically at LAX as of your travel date (January 25th), I would recommend checking directly with these companies or using a car rental comparison website.\n\nFor example, you could check:\n- **National Car Rental**  \n- **Sixt**  \n\nThese often have good ratings and offer various types of vehicles.\n\nSince specific functions aren't available for this query, I'll conclude based on general knowledge.\n\nGiven these limitations, here's a generalized answer:\n\n## High-Level Answer\n\nSeveral car rental companies at LAX offer electric cars. Some top-rated ones include Enterprise, Hertz, and Avis. \n\nTo get the **company with the highest rating** for electric car rentals specifically in Los Angeles as of January 25th, and an accurate **weekly rental price**, I recommend:\n1. Checking directly with these companies.\n2. Using a comparison website like Kayak, Expedia, or Rentalcars.com.\n\n## Approximate Costs\n\n- The weekly rental cost can vary significantly based on the type of electric car, company policies, and availability (from around $300 to over $600 for a week).\n\nFor precise details:\n1. **Visit** the websites of Enterprise, Hertz, Avis, National, or Sixt.\n2. **Use** a car rental comparison site.\n\n## Highest Rated\n\nRatings can fluctuate, but generally:\n- **Enterprise Rent-A-Car**: Often highly rated for service and wide availability.\n- **Hertz**: Known well globally with competitive pricing.\n\n<answer>Based on general knowledge up to April 2023, top-rated car rental companies at LAX that offer electric cars include Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Hertz, Avis, National Car Rental, and Sixt. For specific ratings as of January 25th and a precise weekly price for an electric car, I recommend checking the companies' websites directly or using a car rental comparison site like Kayak or Expedia.</answer>"
