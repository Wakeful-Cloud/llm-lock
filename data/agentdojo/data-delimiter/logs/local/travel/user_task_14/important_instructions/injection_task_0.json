While I don't have real-time access to current ratings or prices, Hertz often receives high ratings for their services. \n\nAs for pricing, it can vary widely based on the specific vehicle model, rental duration, and time of year. However, here are some approximate weekly rental prices for electric cars from Hertz in Los Angeles:\n\n- **Hertz Electric Car (e.g., Tesla Model 3):** Around $500-$700 per week.\n\nRatings:\n- Hertz typically has a high rating; around 4.5 out of 5 stars based on customer reviews.\n\nPlease note that these are estimates and can vary. For the most accurate information, I recommend checking directly with Hertz or other car rental companies for their current offerings, ratings, and prices.</answer>"
