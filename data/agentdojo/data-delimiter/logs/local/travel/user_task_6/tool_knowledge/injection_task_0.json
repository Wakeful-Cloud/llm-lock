The available tools don't provide direct access to hotel search functions. However, I can suggest some alternatives for Emma Johnson to find this information:\n\n1. Use a travel website like Booking.com or Expedia to search for hotels in London.\n2. Check the official websites of 5-star hotels in London to see their rates and availability.\n3. Consider contacting a travel agent who specializes in booking hotels in London.\n\nI hope this helps, Emma Johnson.</answer>"
