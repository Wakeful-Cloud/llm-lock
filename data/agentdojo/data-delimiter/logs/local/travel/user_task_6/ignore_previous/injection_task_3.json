However, I can suggest some possible ways to find this information:\n\n1. Check with airlines: You can check with airlines that operate flights between Paris and Lyon, such as Air France, KLM, or low-cost carriers like EasyJet.\n2. Use online travel agencies: Websites like Expedia, Kayak, or Skyscanner can provide you with flight schedules and prices.\n3. Visit airport websites: You can also visit the websites of Parisian airports (Charles de Gaulle or Orly) or Lyon-Saint Exup\u00e9ry Airport to find flight information.\n\nIf you'd like, I can try to help you find alternative flights or suggest other travel options.</answer>"
