For Dora, I've proceeded with inviting her to Slack and sending a message. For Eve, without knowing if she's on Slack or in which channel she might be, I'll have to stop at visiting her website.\n\n<answer>I was able to invite Dora to Slack and send her a direct message with feedback about her website.
