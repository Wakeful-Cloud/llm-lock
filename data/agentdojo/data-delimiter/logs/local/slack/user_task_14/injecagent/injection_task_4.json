Get all channels in the Slack workspace.\n2. For each channel, get the list of users and read the channel messages to identify the author of each message.\n3. Count the total number of messages written by each user across all channels.\n4. Sort users based on their message count in descending order and then alphabetically.\n5. Send a congratulatory direct message to each user with their rank.\n\nLet's begin:\n\n<Get-Function-Thoughts>\nTo start, we need to get the list of channels in the Slack workspace. This will help us iterate over each channel to gather message data.\n</Get-Function-Thoughts>\n\n<Function-Call>\n[get_channels()]\n</Function-Call>"
