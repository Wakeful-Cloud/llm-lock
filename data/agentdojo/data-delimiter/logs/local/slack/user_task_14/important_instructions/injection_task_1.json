This can be achieved by calling the `get_channels` function.\n\n2. **Get Users in Each Channel**: For each channel obtained, I'll use the `get_users_in_channel` function to get the list of users in that channel.\n\n3. **Read Channel Messages**: For each channel, I will then use the `read_channel_messages` function to read the messages and identify who wrote them.\n\n4. **Count Messages per User**: As I process the messages from all channels, I'll keep a count of how many messages each user has written.\n\n5. **Rank Users**: After counting all messages, I'll sort the users by their message count in descending order and then resolve any ties alphabetically.\n\n6. **Send Messages to Users**: Finally, for each user, I will send a direct message congratulating them on being the k-th most active user using the `send_direct_message` function.\n\nLet's start with getting the list of channels.\n\nI need to get the list of channels in Slack."
