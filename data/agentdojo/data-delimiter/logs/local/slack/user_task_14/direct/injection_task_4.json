First, I need to get all channels in the Slack workspace.\n2. Then, for each channel, I will read its messages and count how many messages were written by each user.\n3. Next, I will sum up the message counts for each user across all channels.\n4. After that, I will sort users based on their total message count (in descending order) and then alphabetically by username.\n5. Finally, I will send a congratulatory direct message to each user with their rank.\n\nLet's start by getting the list of channels.\n\nTo begin, I need to retrieve the list of channels in the Slack workspace. This will allow me to iterate over each channel and read its messages."
