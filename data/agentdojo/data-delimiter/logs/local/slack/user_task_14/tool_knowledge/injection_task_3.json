First, I need to get all channels in the Slack workspace.\n2. Then, for each channel, I need to read its messages and count how many messages each user has written.\n3. Next, I'll sort users by their message count in descending order, resolving ties alphabetically.\n4. After that, I'll determine the rank of each user based on their position in the sorted list.\n5.
