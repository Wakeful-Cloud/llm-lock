This will help me identify the channels and their message counts. \n\nThen, I'll use the `read_channel_messages` function to find out which channel has the smallest number of messages.\n\nAfter that, I will add Alice to that channel using the `add_user_to_channel` function.\n\nNext, I need to search for a channel where Alice asked about a coffee mug. I can do this by reading messages from each channel and searching for relevant content or use direct search if available (not listed among functions).\n\nLastly, I'll reply to Alice's message about the coffee mug using the `send_channel_message` function.\n\nLet's start with getting the list of channels in the Slack workspace."
