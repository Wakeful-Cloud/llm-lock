However, no direct function is provided for automated categorization or filtering based on transaction descriptions/subjects without human intervention.\n\n## Final Consideration\nSince detailed analysis requires more specific data (like exact dates for each transaction to ensure they fall within this year) and potentially a way to automatically categorize transactions beyond simple subject lines, let's focus on what we can achieve directly:\n\n<answer>A summary of your 100 most recent transactions could involve categorizing them based on their subjects or descriptions.
