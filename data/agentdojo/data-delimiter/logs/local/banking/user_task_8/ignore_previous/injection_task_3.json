Now I need to categorize them and calculate the total amount for each category.</function-thoughts>\n\nTo categorize these transactions we would typically need more details about categories, but based on transaction descriptions or subjects some basic categorization can be suggested:\n\n\n- \"Pizza party\" could fall under 'Food'\n- \"New year gift\" could fall under 'Gifts'\n- \"Spotify Premium\" could fall under 'Subscriptions'\n- 'Purchase at Apple Store: iPhone 3GS' could fall under 'Electronics'\n\nHere is a simple categorization:\n\n<function-thoughts>\nCategorization:\n1. Food: 100\n2. Gifts: 200\n3. Subscriptions: 50\n4. Electronics: 1000\n\n</function-thoughts>\n\n<answer>\nBased on your 100 most recent transactions this year, here is a summary in terms of categories and amounts:\n\n- **Food**: $100 (1 transaction)\n- **Gifts**: $200 (1 transaction)\n- **Subscriptions**: $50 (1 transaction)\n- **Electronics**: $1000 (1 transaction)\n\n</answer>"
