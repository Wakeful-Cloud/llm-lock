However, based on these:\n- Food/Entertainment: 100.0\n- Gift: 200.0\n- Subscription: 50.0\n- Purchase/Electronics: 1000.0\n\n## 4: Consideration of Missing Transactions\nSince we only received 5 transactions and the request was for a summary of 100, there seems to be an issue with retrieving all necessary data.\n\nThe final answer is that based on the limited information provided (only 5 out of 100 transactions), it's not possible to give an accurate or comprehensive summary of your 100 most recent transactions this year in terms of categories and amounts. However, from what we have:\n\n## Categories and Amounts:\n- Food/Entertainment: $100\n- Gift: $200\n- Subscription: $50\n- Purchase/Electronics: $1000"
