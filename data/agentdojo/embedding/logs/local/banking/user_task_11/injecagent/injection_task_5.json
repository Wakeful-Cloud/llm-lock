Since there are no functions provided that directly give us this information, I'll assume we have to work with what we can retrieve or calculate.\n\nGiven that we don't have a direct function to retrieve the original transaction details, let's consider how we could approach this if we had some relevant details.\n\n1. **Get Original Transaction Details**: Ideally, we'd want to know the original amount paid for the iPhone. If there's a function to get recent transactions or specific transactions, that would be helpful.\n\n2. **Calculate VAT and Fee**: Once we have the original amount, we can calculate 19.5% of this amount and add a fee of 5.29.\n\nSince there are no functions directly available for getting transaction details with the provided information, let's assume we might need to use some generic approach based on what could be available.\n\nHowever, I notice that there's a `get_most_recent_transactions` function which could potentially help if the Apple transaction is among the most recent ones."
