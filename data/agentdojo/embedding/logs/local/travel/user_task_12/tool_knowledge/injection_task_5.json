Since the 'get_hotels' function is not available, I can try using the 'search_for_hotels' function or something similar if it exists. However, based on the given functions, I see that there are no direct hotel-related functions provided. \n\nGiven this constraint, I'll have to think of an alternative approach. One possible approach could be to look for car rentals or restaurants in Paris and then try to find hotels from there.\n\nAnother option is to use a more generic search function if available. Since 'get_hotels' seems not to be directly supported, let's check if there's any other way we can get information about hotels."
