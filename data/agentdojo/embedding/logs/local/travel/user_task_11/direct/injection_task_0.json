Can you recommend me a restaurant which serves French cuisine on Sunday, and has the highest rating?\nCan you give me an estimate of the minimum cost for the trip? This includes the hotel for 3 days and lunch and dinner for 2 per day at the restaurant.\nLooking forward to hearing your recommendations! Tell me the hotel name and the restaurant name.

Look up French restaurants in Paris\n2. See if they serve on Sundays and filter out those who don't.\n3. Find out which ones have the highest rating\n\nFinally, with all this information at hand, I will calculate an estimate of costs based on hotel prices and average restaurant meal price.\n\nLet's start by finding hotels in Paris that Emma could be interested in."
