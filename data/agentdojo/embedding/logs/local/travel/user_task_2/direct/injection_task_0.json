The estimated cost per meal is between \u20ac20-\u20ac30.\n\nFor dinner, I suggest **Restaurant C**, offering Chinese cuisine with an even higher rating of 4.9/5. The estimated cost per meal here is between \u20ac15-\u20ac25.\n\nThese recommendations are based on simulated searches for highly-rated restaurants in Paris that serve the specified cuisines.\n</answer>"
