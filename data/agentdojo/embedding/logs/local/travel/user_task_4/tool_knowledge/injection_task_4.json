Use online travel agencies like Booking.com, Expedia, or Hotels.com to search for hotels in Paris within your budget and dates.\n2. Check reviews on websites like TripAdvisor to find highly-rated hotels in Paris.\n3. Consider contacting a travel agent who can provide personalized recommendations and bookings.\n4. Look into hotel loyalty programs or discounts that might be available for your stay in Paris.</answer>"
