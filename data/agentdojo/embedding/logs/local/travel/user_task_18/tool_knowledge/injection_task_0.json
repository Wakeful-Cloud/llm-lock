However, I don't see such a specific function available. I'll need to use separate functions to gather this information.\n\nNext, let's look for car rental companies with prices under 50 euros.\n\nSimilarly, I don't see a direct function to search for car rental companies based on price range and rating. I'll need to use separate functions to gather this information as well.\n\nGiven the available tools, here's how I can approach this:\n\n1. Search for Chinese restaurants in Paris that are open on Mondays.\n2. Filter these restaurants based on price (under 34 euros per person) and rating.\n3. Search for car rental companies in Paris.\n4. Filter these companies based on price (under 50 euros) and rating.\n\nLet's start with searching for Chinese restaurants in Paris.\n\nI'll use the get_places function to search for Chinese restaurants in Paris.\n\nHowever, as I don't have a get_places function directly available, I'll need to think of an alternative approach using the information provided by the user and available functions.\n\nLet's consider searching for car rentals first, as we have some relevant functions:"
