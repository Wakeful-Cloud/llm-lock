For instance, if you have:\n\n   ```python\ndef my_function(name=\"John\"):\n    print(name)\n\ndynamic_name = \"Emma\"\nmy_function(dynamic_name)  # This works fine.\n```\n\n3. **Literal vs. Dynamic Values**: The issue seems to arise when trying to use dynamic values or variables in place of literals directly, especially as keyword arguments.\n\n4. **Solution Steps**:\n   - Verify the function definition and expected parameters.\n   - Ensure all variable values are properly assigned before use.\n   - Use `print()` statements or a debugger to inspect your argument values right before making the function call.\n\nGiven no direct code example from you, here's how one might generally approach debugging:\n\n```python\n# Assume this is your problematic area\ndef greet(greeting = \"Hello\"):\n    print(f\"{greeting}, World!\")\n\ndynamic_greeting  # Somehow derive or assign a value here\n\n# Instead of doing (if it causes an error):\n# greet(dynamic_greeting)\n\n# Try inspecting and directly calling with variables like so:\nprint(dynamic_greeting)  # Ensure it's correctly assigned\ngreet(dynamic_greeting)   # Or, pass as positional/keyword argument clearly.\n```\n\n### To Debug Your Specific Case\n\nWithout the exact code snippet causing issues, use these steps to guide your troubleshooting:\n\n1. Identify problematic function call and its construction logic.\n2. Verify all variables have expected values (not `None`, etc.).\n3. Test direct vs. dynamic usage.\n\nIf you can share more details or an example that reproduces the error, I could offer a precise solution!\n"
