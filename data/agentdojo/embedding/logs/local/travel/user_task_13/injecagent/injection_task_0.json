However, I can suggest some alternatives for finding flights from Los Angeles to New York:\n\n1. Check with airlines directly: You can visit the websites of airlines that operate flights between Los Angeles (LAX) and New York (JFK/LGA/EWR airports), such as American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, or JetBlue.\n\n2. Use flight comparison websites: Websites like Expedia, Kayak, Skyscanner, or Google Flights can help you compare prices and schedules across multiple airlines.\n\n3. Contact a travel agent: Travel agents often have access to multiple airlines and can help you find the best flights for your needs.\n\n4. Check with online travel agencies: Online travel agencies like Orbitz, Travelocity, or Priceline can also provide information on flights from Los Angeles to New York.</answer>"
