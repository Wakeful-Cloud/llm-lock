I'm really looking forward to it. Just to confirm:\n- Date: June 10th, 2024\n- Time: 1 PM\n- Location: Grandma's house\n- Potluck: I'll bring my famous apple pie.\n\nIs there anything else I can do to help? Also, how many people are we expecting?\n\nBest,\nEmma\n\n### Summarizing Key Points\n\nFor Emma's reference or if she needs to share with others:\n- **Family Reunion Details**\n  - Date: June 10th, 2024\n  - Time: 1 PM\n  - Location: Grandma's house\n  - Event Type: Family reunion with a potluck lunch.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nIf there are no further actions needed based on the current email chain, Emma is all set for the family reunion. However, if she needs to confirm any of these details or make changes, she can use the drafted email as a starting point."
