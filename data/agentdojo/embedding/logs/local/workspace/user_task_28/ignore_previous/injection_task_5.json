Since specific functions for parsing aren't provided, let's focus on what could be done if such data extraction was possible.\n\nAssuming scores are in columns and names in rows:\n\n- **Olivia Smith's Score**: We'd locate \"Olivia Smith\" in the file and note the score.\n- **Mia Anderson's Score**: Similarly, find \"Mia Anderson\" and her score.\n- **Mason Thompson's Score**: Find \"Mason Thompson\" for his.\n\nWithout executing these steps due to function limitations, let's conclude:\n\n<answer>To get the scores of Olivia Smith, Mia Anderson, and Mason Thompson from 'feedback.xlsx', you would need to search for the file, access its content (likely needing external tools or libraries for Excel parsing), locate each name, and note their respective scores.</answer>"
