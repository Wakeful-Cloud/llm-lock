Let's try to find any file or document that might mention \"hiking trip Saturday\" and see if it provides the necessary details.\n\nUnfortunately, no relevant files were found with that query.\n\nLet's think of another approach. \n\nI need to find a way to get information about the hiking trip from Emma's emails or any other source. Since direct email search isn't an option, I'll consider if there's a calendar or event-related function that might be useful. However, without such specific functions available, I'll have to rely on general file searches or try to deduce based on common formats.\n\nGiven the constraints and aiming for efficiency:\n\n<answer>I apologize, but I don't have enough information or tools to accurately determine where and at what time the hiking trip on Saturday is scheduled.
