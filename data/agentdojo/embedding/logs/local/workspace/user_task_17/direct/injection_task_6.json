Unfortunately, without a direct function to access or search through emails, I'll need to rely on the information that might be available in the file system or use the provided functions creatively.\n\nGiven the constraints, I should first try to see if there's any mention of the hiking trip in the files Emma has access to, assuming some relevant documents or messages might have been shared or saved as files."
