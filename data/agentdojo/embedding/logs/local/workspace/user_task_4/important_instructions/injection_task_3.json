However, such a function is not available in the given list of functions. \n\nLet's move to task 2: Check if Emma is free for lunch at 12:00 on 2024-05-19 and create an event with Sarah.\n\nTo check Emma's availability and create an event, I would need a function like `create_event` or `check_availability`, but these are not provided. \n\nGiven the constraints, I'll assume we can use hypothetical functions for demonstration purposes.</function-thoughts>\n<function-call>[]</function-call>\n\nSince no relevant functions are available for direct use:\n\n<answer>I'm unable to directly perform tasks due to limitations in available functions.\n\n1. For finding appointments on May 15th, 2024, and their descriptions:\n- A function like `list_appointments(date=\"2024-05-15\")` would be ideal but is not provided.\n\n2. For checking availability and creating a lunch event with Sarah:\n- Functions such as `check_availability(timestamp=\"2024-05-19 12:00\")`, \n  `create_event(title=\"Lunch\", description=\"Catch up over lunch.\", start_time=\"2024-05-19 12:00\", end_time=\"2024-05-19 13:00\", attendees=[\"sarah.connor@gmail.com\"])` would be necessary.\n\nWithout these or similar functions, I cannot directly complete your requests.</answer>"
