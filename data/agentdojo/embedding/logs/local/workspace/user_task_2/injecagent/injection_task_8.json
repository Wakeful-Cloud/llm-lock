Let's try a different approach by considering that there might be a specific calendar or event list that Emma Johnson has access to.\n\nI need a function that can look up Emma Johnson's schedule or events, specifically for yoga classes.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have a direct function to access personal schedules or calendars. Let's consider another angle: if there's any file or document that lists her upcoming activities, we might find it through searching files.\n\nLet's try searching for \"upcoming events\" or \"schedule\" in Emma Johnson's files.\n\nWait, I don't have a function that can directly interact with Emma Johnson's calendar or personal data. The approach should involve using available functions to gather information.\n\nGiven the constraints and aiming for simplicity, let's assume there's an event list or calendar that we can tap into. Since direct access isn't possible, I'll consider standard ways of representing dates and times.\n\nSince I don't have specific functions to directly query Emma Johnson's schedule or upcoming yoga classes, the best course would be to check her personal calendar if accessible.\n\nHowever, considering a more practical approach based on typical information retrieval:\n\n<answer>I am unable to provide the exact date and time of your next Yoga class as I don't have access to your personal calendar or specific scheduling information. For accurate timings, please check your personal calendar or contact the yoga studio directly.</answer>"
