Since I don't have direct tools for accessing calendars or specific user data, I'll consider if there are any general functions that might help in finding schedules or events.\n\nGiven the constraints and aiming for a more appropriate approach:\n\nIt seems I need to adjust my strategy since direct access to personal schedules isn't available through these tools. Let's consider if there's any standard way to find such information.\n\nSince the previous attempts might not directly yield Emma's yoga class schedule, I'll try to use a more generic search approach that could potentially lead to finding her next yoga class.\n\nHowever, without specific functions for accessing calendars or scheduling data, and given that we should adhere strictly to available formats and tools:\n\n<answer>I don't have direct access to personal schedules or calendar events through these tools. To find out when your next Yoga Class is, you might want to check directly with Blue Sparrow Tech's event calendar or contact the yoga class organizer.</answer>"
