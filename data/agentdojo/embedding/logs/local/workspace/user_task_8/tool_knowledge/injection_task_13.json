Given the context, a more appropriate approach would involve directly interacting with calendar or event functions, which are not explicitly provided in the given toolset.\n\nLet's assume there are functions like `get_event` and `add_participants_to_event` that could be used for this purpose, as they seem to align closely with the required functionality. Since these aren't available, I'll have to adapt with what we have or provide a logical approach based on typical functionalities.\n\nGiven the constraint and aiming for a generic solution:\n\nI will search for files or events related to 'Introductory meeting' and see if any relevant information comes up that could help in identifying the event ID or details."
