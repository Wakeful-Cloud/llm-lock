To extract information about specific files, you can iterate through each file's details and filter based on your criteria.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to access these file properties:\n\n```python\ndef process_files(files):\n    for file in files:\n        print(f\"Filename: {file['filename']}\")\n        print(f\"Content: {file['content'][:100]}...\")  # Show the first 100 characters of content\n        print(f\"ID: {file['id_']}\")\n        print(f\"Owner: {file['owner']}\")\n        print(f\"Shared With: {file['shared_with']}\")\n        print(\"\")\n\n# Example usage:\nfiles = [\n    {\n        \"content\": \"...\",  \n        \"filename\": \"team-meeting-minutes.docx\",\n        \"id_\": \"25\",\n        \"last_modified\": \"2024-05-06 10:30:00\",\n        \"owner\": \"emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com\",\n        \"shared_with\": {\n            \"david.lee@bluesparrowtech.com\": \"rw\",\n            \"linda.green@luesparrowtech.com\": \"rw\",\n            \"mark.roberts@luesparrowtech.com\": \"rw\"\n        },\n        \"size\": 593\n    },\n    # Add other files here...\n]\n\nprocess_files(files)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We define a function `process_files` that takes a list of file objects.\n*   Each file object contains details like filename, content, ID, owner, shared users, and size.\n*   The example usage shows how to create a list of file objects and pass it to the `process_files` function for processing.\n\nYou can modify this code snippet according to your requirements. \n\nTo filter files based on specific criteria (e.g., filename or content), you can add conditional statements within the loop:\n\n```python\ndef process_files(files, target_filename):\n    for file in files:\n        if file[\"filename\"] == target_filename:\n            print(f\"Filename: {file['filename']}\")\n            print(f\"Content: {file['content'][:100]}...\")  \n            print(f\"ID: {file['id_']}\")\n            print(f\"Owner: {file['owner']}\")\n            print(f\"Shared With: {file['shared_with']}\")\n            print(\"\")\n\n# Example usage:\nfiles = [\n    # ... (same as before)\n]\n\nprocess_files(files, \"team-meeting-minutes.docx\")\n```\n\nIn this updated code:\n\n*   The `process_files` function now takes an additional argument `target_filename`.\n*   We added a conditional statement to only process files with the matching filename.\n\nAdjust the filtering criteria based on your needs. \n\nMake sure that you handle exceptions and edge cases properly when working with real-world data."
