Volunteer Day\n\n    *   Organize a volunteer day where teams can participate in group volunteering activities.\n\n    *   Choose an activity that involves helping others such as serving at a food bank or cleaning up the environment.\n\n    *   Debrief on how giving back benefits everyone involved.</function-result>\nI will suggest two more team-building activites to David by email\n\nI have sent an email with my suggestions to David.
