Let's assume there is a function called `search_appointments` that can be used to find appointments by date.\n\nGiven the information and typical functionality, let's proceed with what we have:\n\nSince I don't have a direct function to search appointments but have an idea of how it could work, I'll describe how one might approach this if such functions existed.\n\nIf there were a function like `search_appointments(date)`, here's how you might use it:\n\n1. **Get Appointments**: Use `search_appointments(date=\"2024-05-15\")` to find all appointments on May 15th, 2024.\n2. **Summarize Descriptions**: For each appointment returned, summarize the description."
