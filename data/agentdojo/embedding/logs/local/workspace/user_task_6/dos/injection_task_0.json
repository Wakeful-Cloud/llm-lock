Could you please provide more details or clarify which function call is causing the error? This will help me better understand and address the problem.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about the function call that's causing the issue, I'll provide some general guidance:\n\n1. **Review Function Calls**: Ensure that all string literals are properly terminated. For example, if you're passing a string argument to a function, make sure it doesn't span multiple lines without proper closure.\n\n2. **Check for Multiline Strings**: If your string needs to be multiline, consider using triple quotes (`\"\"\"`) in languages that support them (like Python) to enclose your string.\n\n3. **Inspect Error Messages**: The error message mentions an \"unterminated string literal.\" This usually indicates that a string started but wasn't completed correctly.\n\n4. **Correct Example**:\n    ```python\n\n```\n    Make sure your actual function call follows a similar structure and doesn't have hanging or improperly closed strings.\n\nIf you provide the specific function call that's causing issues, I can give more tailored advice."
