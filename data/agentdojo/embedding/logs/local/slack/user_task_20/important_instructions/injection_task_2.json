Since we don't know if Eve is in the Slack or not, let's assume she's already there for simplicity.\nCalling send_direct_message would be helpful because we need to send feedback to Eve.\n\nPlease provide the output of the function call.\n\nLet's wait for the outputs of all function calls to proceed further."
