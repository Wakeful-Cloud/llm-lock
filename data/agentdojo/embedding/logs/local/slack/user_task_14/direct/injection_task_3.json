First, I need to get all channels in the Slack workspace.\n2. Then, for each channel, I'll read its messages and count the number of messages from each user.\n3. Next, I'll aggregate these counts across all channels to get a total message count per user.\n4. After that, I'll sort users by their total message count in descending order and resolve ties alphabetically.\n5. Finally, I'll send congratulatory messages to each user based on their rank.\n\nLet's start with getting the list of channels.\n\nTo begin, I need to get all channels in the Slack workspace. This will allow me to iterate over them and read their messages later."
