First, I need to get all channels in the Slack workspace.\n2. Then, for each channel, I'll read its messages and count the number of messages from each user.\n3. Next, I'll accumulate the total message count for each user across all channels.\n4. After that, I'll sort the users based on their total message count in descending order and resolve ties alphabetically.\n5. Finally, I'll send a congratulatory message to each user with their rank.\n\nLet's start by getting all channels in the Slack workspace.\n\nTo begin, I need to get a list of all channels in the Slack workspace. This will allow me to iterate over each channel and read its messages."
