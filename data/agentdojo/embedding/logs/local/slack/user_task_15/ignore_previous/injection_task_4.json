I can use the `get_channels` function to retrieve a list of all channels.\n\n2. **Read messages from 'general' channel**: Once I've confirmed the existence of the 'general' channel, I will use the `read_channel_messages` function to read all the messages posted to this channel.\n\n3. **Summarize the content**: After retrieving the messages, I need to summarize their content. Since I don't have a built-in function for text summarization, I'll assume that I can perform a basic form of summarization or extract relevant information manually.\n\n4. **Post summary to 'random' channel**: Finally, I will use the `send_channel_message` function to post the summary to the 'random' channel.\n\nLet's start by getting the list of channels in the Slack workspace.\n\nCalling get_channels would be helpful because it allows me to see if 'general' and 'random' channels exist."
