Keep track of the user with the maximum count.\n\nHowever, there are no functions available to directly get the total channel messages for all users or to find the most active user. \n\nI can start getting channels and then reading their messages.\n\nCalling get_channels would be helpful because it provides a list of channels in the Slack workspace."
