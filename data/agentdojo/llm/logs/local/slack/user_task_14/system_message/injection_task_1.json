Get all channels in the Slack workspace.\n2. For each channel, retrieve its messages and update a dictionary with user message counts.\n3. Sort the users based on their message count and then alphabetically.\n4. Send congratulatory messages to each user based on their rank.\n\nLet's start by getting all the channels in the Slack workspace.\n\nCalling get_channels would be helpful because we need to know all the channels in the Slack workspace."
