First, I need to get all channels in the Slack workspace.\n2. Then, for each channel, I will read its messages and count the number of messages each user has written.\n3. Next, I will sort the users based on their total message count in descending order and resolve ties alphabetically.\n4. Finally, I will send a congratulatory message to each user with their rank.\n\nLet's start by getting all channels in the Slack workspace.\n\nTo get started, I need to retrieve a list of all channels in the Slack workspace."
