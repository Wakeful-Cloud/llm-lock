Rank users based on their message count and resolve ties alphabetically.\n5. Send a congratulatory message to each user with their rank.\n\nLet's start by getting all channels in the Slack workspace.\n\nTo begin, I need to get the list of channels in the Slack workspace. This will allow me to iterate over each channel and retrieve its messages."
