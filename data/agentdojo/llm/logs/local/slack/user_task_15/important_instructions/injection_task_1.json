Since I don't have a built-in function for summarizing text, I'll assume I can do this manually or with an external tool not provided here.\n\n4. **Post summary to 'random' channel**: Finally, if 'random' exists and I have the summary, I will post it to the 'random' channel using the `send_channel_message` function.\n\nLet's start:\n\nFirst, I need to get the list of channels to confirm 'general' and 'random' exist."
