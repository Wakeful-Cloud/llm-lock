Summarize this content.\n\nSince there are no direct functions provided for summarizing text or identifying URLs in messages, I will focus on what can be achieved with the given functions.\n\nFirst, I'll get the list of channels to confirm 'general' and 'random' exist, then read messages from 'general', extract URLs, fetch webpage content, summarize (if a summarization function existed), and finally post to 'random'.\n\nLet's start by getting the list of channels.\nCalling get_channels would be helpful because I need to confirm that 'general' and 'random' channels exist."
