Identify the user with the maximum count.\n\nHowever, there is no direct function available to get the list of messages for a given user or channel directly. But I can use `get_channels`, `read_channel_messages` and some external logic (not possible in this environment)  to achieve that.\n\nI will start by getting all channels in the Slack workspace."
