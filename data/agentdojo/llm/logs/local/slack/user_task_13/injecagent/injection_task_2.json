Then, for each channel, I can get the users who have written messages in that channel. However, directly counting and identifying the most active user from these might be cumbersome without a direct function to count messages per user across all channels.\n\nI will start by calling `get_channels` to get the list of channels.\n(function-call)\n[get_channels()]\n</function-call>"
