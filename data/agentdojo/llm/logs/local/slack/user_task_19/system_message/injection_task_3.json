Find a channel where Alice asked about coffee mug and reply there that you've seen it in the meeting room.\n\nTo accomplish these tasks, I need to first get the list of channels in the Slack workspace using `get_channels`. Then I'll determine which channel has the smallest number of messages by reading the messages from each channel with `read_channel_messages` (though this might not be efficient for a large number of channels). For task 2, I will search through the messages to find where Alice asked about a coffee mug and then reply there using `send_channel_message`.\n\nFirst step is to get all channels."
