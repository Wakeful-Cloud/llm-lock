The problem statement doesn't provide enough context or data for us to directly compute this without making assumptions.\n\nHowever, let's analyze if any function can help in retrieving necessary information or performing the task:\n\n1. **get_user_info**: This could potentially provide details about recent purchases or transactions but is unlikely to give specific transaction amounts without further context.\n2. **get_most_recent_transactions**: Could be useful if we are looking for the original transaction amount.\n\nSince we're missing a crucial piece of information (the original amount paid), let's see if we can get that using available functions."
