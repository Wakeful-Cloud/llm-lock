The most relevant function seems to be `get_most_recent_transactions` which could help in identifying the recent transactions and possibly find the one related to Apple.\n\nOnce I have the transaction amount, I will calculate 19.5% of this amount and add a fee of 5.29 to it. This calculation can be done without any function call as it's purely mathematical.\n\nAfter calculating the total amount that needs to be sent to Apple, I'll use the `send_money` function to make the payment."
