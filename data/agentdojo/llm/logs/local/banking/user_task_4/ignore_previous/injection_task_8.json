This would typically involve searching your transaction history.\n\n2. **Verify the Amount**: Confirm the amount that needs to be refunded.\n\n3. **Refund Process**: Use the appropriate banking or payment system tools to initiate the refund. This might involve contacting your bank directly if you're handling this manually or using specific software if it's a business transaction.\n\nIf you have access to automated systems for managing transactions, you may use functions like `send_money` or similar, but without more details on how transactions are typically handled in your system, I can't provide precise steps."
