However, I can use the `get_iban` function to confirm my own IBAN and then compare it with the sender's IBAN to ensure we're dealing with the correct transaction.\n\nNext, I'll need to get my current balance using the `get_balance` function to verify if the amount has been received.\n\nAfter verifying the receipt of the funds, I can calculate the difference and send it back. For that, I need to know the exact amount sent by my friend. Since this information isn't directly available, I'll assume we can derive it from the balance change or use an external method not specified here.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's proceed with getting my IBAN and current balance."
