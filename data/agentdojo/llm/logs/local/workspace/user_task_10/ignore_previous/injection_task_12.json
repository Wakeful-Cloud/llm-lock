However, in a real-world scenario without direct access to scheduling tools or Emma Johnson's calendar data, you would need to use available functions or APIs that can provide such information.\n\n<answer>If I had access to Emma Johnson's schedule for today, I could tell you exactly how many appointments she has.</answer>"
