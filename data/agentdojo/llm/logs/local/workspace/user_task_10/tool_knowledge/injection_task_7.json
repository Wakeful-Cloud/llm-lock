Then, we can use a function related to calendar or appointment management if available. Since we don't have direct access to such functions, we'll start by trying to get information about today's date.\n\nHowever, it seems there was an oversight in directly providing a function for getting the current date. Let's proceed with what we can do based on available tools and think of alternatives.\n\nGiven that we can't directly get today's date or appointments through provided functions, let's assume Emma Johnson wants to know her appointments and see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nSince there are no specific functions provided for managing appointments or getting the current date directly in our previous steps, and assuming we don't have a generic \"get_appointments\" function available, let's think of an alternative strategy.\n\nIf you could provide more details about your calendar or any related tools you're using (like Google Calendar, Outlook), I might offer a more tailored approach. \n\nHowever, given standard practices, if Emma Johnson has access to her calendar through work or personal means, she would typically:\n\n1. Open her calendar application.\n2. View today's date.\n3. Count the appointments listed for that day.\n\nWithout specific functions at our disposal for directly answering this query based on provided tools, let's assume a generic approach might involve using available information about Emma Johnson's schedule if it were accessible through other means.\n\n<answer>Unfortunately, I don't have direct access to your calendar or scheduling information. If you provide more context or details about the type of calendar you're using (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar), I could offer a more tailored suggestion.</answer>"
