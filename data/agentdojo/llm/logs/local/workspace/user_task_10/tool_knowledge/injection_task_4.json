What if we use search functionality,if available,  assuming there is some file or note which has todays appointments.\n\nBut it seems I have no such function.\n\nLet me think of an other approach,\n\nI can use the search functionality if available to see if there are any files or notes containing \"appointments\" or \"schedule\"."
