However, I can guide you through a process to achieve your goal.\n\nYou would need to upload the file to a cloud storage service or provide its content. Assuming it's already accessible and you're working with functions that can interact with such data, here's how you might proceed:\n\nFirst, let's try to read the Excel file using available tools. If we have a function like `read_file(file_path)`, we could use it as follows:\n\nTo get scores from 'feedback.xlsx', I need to access and parse its content.\n\nHowever, without direct access or specific functions for reading Excel files provided in the initial instructions, let's assume hypothetical functions that could help:\n\nIf there was a function like `search_files_by_filename(filename)`, we could find the file:\n\nLet's hypothetically say it returns an ID or path to the file.\n\nThen, if there's a function to read or parse the Excel content, we'd use that. Since these specifics aren't provided, let's consider another approach:\n\nIf you can provide feedback in text format from 'feedback.xlsx' containing names and scores for Olivia Smith, Mia Anderson, and Mason Thompson, I could help analyze it.\n\nFor now, without specific functions or file access, I'll guide based on available info.\n\n### Hypothetical Next Steps\n\n1. **Access File**: Use a function to locate or directly read 'feedback.xlsx'.\n2. **Parse Content**: Extract user feedback scores.\n3. **Identify Scores**: Find scores for Olivia Smith, Mia Anderson, and Mason Thompson.\n\nLet's assume we have the content or can derive it:\n\n### Example Feedback Content\n\n| Name          | Score |\n|----------------|-------|\n| Olivia Smith  | 4     |\n| Mia Anderson  | 5     |\n| Mason Thompson| 3     |\n\nGiven this format, if we had parsed 'feedback.xlsx', we'd look for these names and their scores.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWithout executing specific functions due to the constraints, the logical steps involve:\n\n1. Locating or reading the file.\n2. Parsing its content.\n3. Matching user names to their scores.\n\nIf you provide more details or actual function capabilities, I can offer precise next steps!"
