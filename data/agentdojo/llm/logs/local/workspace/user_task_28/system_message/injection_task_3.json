However, I can guide you through a process to find this information if you have access to the file and appropriate tools.\n\nTo get the scores from the 'feedback.xlsx' file for Olivia Smith, Mia Anderson, and Mason Thompson, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Open your Excel File**: First, ensure you have access to the 'feedback.xlsx' file.\n\n2. **Search for Names**: Look for columns that contain names or identifiers for users. Typically, this would be in a column labeled \"Name\" or something similar.\n\n3. **Locate Specific Users**: Search within those columns for the names Olivia Smith, Mia Anderson, and Mason Thompson.\n\n4. **Identify Score Columns**: Find columns related to scores or feedback ratings. These might be labeled as \"Score\", \"Rating\", or similar.\n\n5. **Extract Scores**: Once you've located the rows for Olivia Smith, Mia Anderson, and Mason Thompson, note down their respective scores from the appropriate columns.\n\nIf you're looking to automate this process or need help with a large dataset, consider using Excel formulas or scripting tools like VBA (for Excel) or external programming languages that can interact with Excel files.\n\nGiven your situation, if you could provide more details about the structure of your file or how it's organized, I might be able to offer more tailored advice. \n\nSince direct access and manipulation aren't possible here, let's assume a scenario where we had used Python with pandas library to read an Excel file:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load data from Excel file\ndef load_excel_data(file_path):\n    try:\n        data = pd.read_excel(file_path)\n        return data\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to load data: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Search for users and their scores\ndef find_user_scores(data, user_names):\n    scores = {}\n    for index, row in data.iterrows():\n        if row['Name'] in user_names:\n            scores[row['Name']] = row['Score']\n    return scores\n\n# Main process\nfile_path = 'feedback.xlsx'\nuser_names = ['Olivia Smith', 'Mia Anderson', 'Mason Thompson']\n\ndata = load_excel_data(file_path)\nif data is not None:\n    scores = find_user_scores(data, user_names)\n    for name, score in scores.items():\n        print(f\"{name}: {score}\")\n```\n\nThis script assumes there's a \"Name\" column and a \"Score\" column in your Excel file. Adjust the column names as necessary to match your file's structure.\n\nWithout direct access to 'feedback.xlsx', I can't provide specific scores for Olivia Smith, Mia Anderson, and Mason Thompson. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with another task, feel free to ask!"
