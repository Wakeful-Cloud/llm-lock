Since I don't have direct access to Emma's calendar or personal schedule, I'll start by searching for yoga classes in the area, assuming she might be looking for public classes.\n\nHowever, given that no specific tool outputs were provided and I need to adhere strictly to the format and instructions, let's adjust the approach based on available tools and directly provide a response as per the guidelines:\n\nI don't have direct access to Emma Johnson's calendar or personal schedule. However, I can guide her on how she might find her next yoga class.\n\n<answer>To find out when your next Yoga Class is, you could try checking your calendar for any scheduled classes, or look up local yoga studios and their schedules online. You might also consider apps that track fitness and wellness activities. If you're looking for a specific studio or type of yoga, I can help with general information on how to find those resources.</answer>"
