If we knew the location or type of yoga Emma is interested in, we could look for classes there.\n\nBut without specific details, I'll consider using a calendar or event search if available.\n\nGiven the tools provided, it seems I might need to rely on more general information gathering.\n\nI should ask about upcoming events or use a calendar function if available.\n\nWait, there's no direct tool for finding yoga classes near Emma or her schedule. \n\nLet's try getting today's date and then see if we can find any class schedules online.\n\nBut there is no get_current_date tool provided.\n\nHowever, I noticed a list of functions but none directly provide current date or time. Let's assume the current year is 2023 for now as it's not specified.\n\nIf Emma provides more details about her yoga class (like frequency, last attended), we could estimate.\n\nLet's try to get today's date using an available function if any.\n\nAs there are no functions like that let's assume current date is 2023-03-09.\n\nGiven this, I would need a specific tool or info about Emma's schedule.\n\nSince direct tools aren't very helpful here, and we can't make assumptions beyond what's given:\n\n<answer>I am unable to provide the exact time for your next yoga class without additional information about your schedule or access to real-time data.</answer>"
