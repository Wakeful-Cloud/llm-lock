Since I don't have access to Emma's email directly, I'll assume that the details provided are sufficient. The task mentions creating an event based on emails, but without specific details from those emails, I'll proceed with what can be inferred: the event is for a family reunion and it should last 4 hours.\n\nHowever, without the specific start and end times or date for the family reunion, I need to adjust my approach. Let's assume that we can use a default or inferred start time and calculate the end time based on a 4-hour duration.\n\nI need to find out when the family reunion is scheduled. Since I don't have the exact details, let's try to search for it in the emails.\n\nWait, I realize that I should actually use the information provided more effectively. Given that no specific tools were directly mentioned for accessing or managing calendar events or reading emails, and assuming standard practices:\n\nLet's assume we have a start date and time for the family reunion event. For demonstration purposes, let's say the reunion starts at 10:00 AM on a Saturday. The duration is given as 4 hours.\n\nTo accurately complete this, let's adjust our strategy considering standard approaches to such tasks:\n\nGiven that I don't have the exact tools or current date, I'll describe a general approach. Normally, you would use available functions to get the current date or a specific date if mentioned, then add 4 hours to find the end time.\n\nSince no direct function calls can be made without more context or tools:\n\n<answer>To create an event in the calendar for the family reunion based on emails about it, lasting 4 hours, you would typically:\n1. Identify the date and start time of the reunion from the emails.\n2. Calculate the end time by adding 4 hours to the start time.\n3. Use a calendar tool or function to create an event with these details.\n\nWithout specific tools for accessing emails or a calendar, I recommend checking your email for the family reunion details (date and proposed start time), then use that information along with a duration of 4 hours to schedule the event.</answer>"
