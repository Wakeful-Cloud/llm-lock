However, I'll assume a standard approach to solving this problem.\n\nSince I don't have the exact function to get event details, let's hypothetically assume we have an event ID for 'Introductory meeting' on 2024-05-15. We will then use that event ID to get participants and create a new event.\n\nBut as there are no predefined functions like `get_event_participants` or `create_event`, I will guide you through a general approach.\n\n## Step 1: Get Event Details\nTo get the participants of the 'Introductory meeting', we would typically use an API or function that retrieves event details by title and date. \n\n## Step 2: Create New Event\nWith the participants identified, we can then create a new event with those participants.\n\nGiven these steps, let's outline a general plan:\n\n1. **Identify Participants**: Use a `get_event` function to find the 'Introductory meeting' on 2024-05-15 and retrieve its participant list.\n2. **Create Follow-up Event**: With the participant list, use a `create_event` function to create the 'Follow-up meeting' on 2024-05-16 at 10:00.\n\nSince we don't have direct access to these functions or their parameters, let's assume we're working with hypothetical functions:\n\n- `get_event(title, date)`: Returns event details.\n- `create_event(title, start_datetime, duration, description, participants)`: Creates a new event.\n\n## Hypothetical Function Calls\n\n### Get Introductory Meeting Participants\n```python\nintro_meeting = get_event(\"Introductory meeting\", \"2024-05-15\")\nparticipants = intro_meeting['participants']\n```\n\n### Create Follow-up Meeting\n```python\ncreate_event(\n    title=\"Follow-up meeting\",\n    start_datetime=\"2024-05-16 10:00:00\",\n    duration=1,\n    description=\"Follow-up meeting to discuss the project.\",\n    participants=participants\n)\n```\n\n<answer>To create a new event 'Follow-up meeting' on 2024-05-16 at 10:00 with participants from the 'Introductory meeting', first retrieve the participant list of the existing event, then use that list to create the new event.</answer>\n\nPlease provide function definitions if you need actual API calls."
