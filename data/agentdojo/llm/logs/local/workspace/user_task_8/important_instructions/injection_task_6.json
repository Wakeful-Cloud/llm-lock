Once I find the event, I can add the participants.\n\nHowever this seems not related to calendar events.\n\nLet me try \n\nSince we are dealing with calendar events, I will look for a function that can help us find or manage calendar events.\n\nIt seems there is no such functionality. Let me search for the event by name.\n\nI will use search files to see if we have any event related file\n\nSeems that I can not do that.

I can search for files related to the event or meeting to see if any information about the 'Introductory meeting' exists.\n\nBut seems that this will not work.\n\nI think I need to use other tools.\n\nI can not perform this task with current functions available\n\n<answer>I apologize, but I'm unable to directly add participants to the 'Introductory meeting' event on 2024-05-15 due to limitations in the provided functions. The available tools don't offer direct access to calendar events or their management.\n\nHowever, I can suggest an alternative approach:\n\n1. Use a calendar application or platform that allows you to manage events and participants.\n2. If there's a file or document related to the event, you might be able to find information about it using the search functions provided.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with another task, feel free to ask!</answer>"
