However, since I don't have direct access to event IDs or calendars, I'll assume a hypothetical scenario where we've identified the event ID as `event123`.\n\n2. **Identify Participants**: The participants to be added are:\n   - john.doe@clientcorp.com\n   - maria.garcia@bluesparrowtech.com\n\n3. **Add Participants**: We will use the `add_calendar_event_participants` function to add these participants to the event.\n\nGiven the information and tools available, here's how I would proceed:\n\nTo add john.doe@clientcorp.com and maria.garcia@bluesparrowtech.com to the 'Introductory meeting' event, we first need to find the event ID. Assuming we have identified the event as having the ID \"event123\", we can then use the add_calendar_event_participants function."
