This suggests that the problem lies in how the function call was constructed or executed.\n\nGiven the context, it seems like the function call might have been made with incorrect or dynamic arguments instead of literal ones. However, without a specific function call to examine, I'll provide general guidance on constructing valid function calls.\n\nIn Python, when making function calls, especially through tools or dynamically generated code, it's essential to ensure that all arguments are properly defined and passed as literals or directly assignable values.\n\nFor instance, if you have a function like this:\n\n```python\ndef my_function(a, b):\n    return f\"a: {a}, b: {b}\"\n```\n\nA valid call would be:\n\n```python\nmy_function(\"hello\", 123)\n```\n\nOr with keyword arguments:\n\n```python\nmy_function(a=\"hello\", b=123)\n```\n\nEnsure that when you're constructing or calling functions, especially in a loop or dynamic context, that your arguments are correctly passed.\n\nLet's assume we need to call `check_status` with specific parameters.
