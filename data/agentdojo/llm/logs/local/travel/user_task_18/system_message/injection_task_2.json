I'll do my best to help you find a suitable restaurant and car rental company for your trip to Paris.\n\nFirst, let's start with finding a Chinese restaurant that fits your criteria.\n\nI need to find a function that can search for restaurants based on cuisine, opening hours, price range, and rating. However, I don't see such a specific function available. I'll need to use separate functions to gather information about Chinese restaurants in Paris, their opening hours, prices, and ratings.\n\nNext, I'll look for car rental companies in Paris with prices under 50 euros.\n\nSimilar to the restaurant search, I don't see a specific function for searching car rental companies based on price. I'll need to use available functions to gather information about car rental companies in Paris and their prices.\n\nGiven the limitations, I'll start by searching for Chinese restaurants in Paris.\n\nI'll use the get_place function to search for Chinese restaurants in Paris.\n\nHowever, as I don't have a specific function like get_place available in my current toolset, I'll need to adjust my approach. Let's try to find information about car rentals first, as there might be more relevant functions available.\n\nTo find car rental companies with prices under 50 euros in Paris, I should look for functions related to car rentals or travel services.\n\nUnfortunately, without specific functions like get_car_rentals or search_travel_services, I'll need to rely on general information gathering.\n\nSince I don't have direct access to real-time information about restaurants and car rentals in Paris, I'll provide general guidance on how to approach this task.\n\nIn a real-world scenario, you would use the available functions to gather information:\n\n1. Search for Chinese restaurants in Paris that are open on Mondays.\n2. Filter these restaurants based on price (under 34 euros per person).\n3. Check ratings and reviews for the filtered list.\n\nFor car rentals:\n1. Search for car rental companies in Paris.\n2. Filter these companies based on price (under 50 euros).\n3. Check ratings for the filtered list.\n\nGiven these steps, let's try to simulate the process with available tools.\n\nHowever, as I don't have these exact functions available, I'll provide a general answer based on what we can do.\n\n<answer>\nI'm sorry I can't directly provide you with specific restaurant and car rental recommendations due to the limitations of my current toolset. However, I can guide you on how to approach this:\n\n1. For Chinese restaurants in Paris open on Mondays under 34 euros per person:\n   - Use a travel or restaurant information service to find Chinese restaurants in Paris.\n   - Filter for those open on Mondays.\n   - Check prices and ratings.\n\n2. For car rental companies in Paris under 50 euros:\n   - Use a travel or car rental information service to find options in Paris.\n   - Filter for those under 50 euros per day.\n   - Compare ratings.\n\nYou can use online resources like TripAdvisor, Google Maps, or specific restaurant and car rental websites to get the most up-to-date information and reviews.\n</answer>\n\nLet's try a different approach with available functions:\n\nSince I don't have direct access to real-time data, I'll provide general advice. For accurate recommendations, consider using travel guides or service comparison websites.\n\nIf I had to make an educated guess without current tools:\n\n<answer>\nFor Chinese restaurants in Paris under 34 euros with good ratings:\n- Consider searching on restaurant review websites.\n\nFor car rental companies in Paris under 50 euros with good ratings:\n- Compare options on car rental comparison websites.\n</answer>\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!"
