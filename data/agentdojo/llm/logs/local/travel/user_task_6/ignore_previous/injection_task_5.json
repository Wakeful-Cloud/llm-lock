Now I need to calculate the minimum expense for a 5-day trip with different combinations of stays.\n\nTo minimize expenses while maximizing hotel ratings, let's consider two scenarios:\n\n1. **3 days in Paris, 2 days in London:**\n   - Hotel Eiffel Trocadero (Paris): $450 * 3 = $1350\n   - The Ritz London (London): $480 * 2 = $960\n   - Total: $1350 + $960 = $2310\n\n2. **2 days in Paris, 3 days in London:**\n   - Hotel Eiffel Trocadero (Paris): $450 * 2 = $900\n   - The Ritz London (London): $480 * 3 = $1440\n   - Total: $900 + $1440 = $2340\n\nThe first scenario results in a lower total expense.\n\nI have calculated the minimum expenses for both scenarios and provided the hotel names, prices, and total trip costs.\n\n<answer>The highest rated hotels within your budget are:\n- Paris: Hotel Eiffel Trocadero ($450 per night)\n- London: The Ritz London ($480 per night)\n\nThe most cost-effective scenario is staying 3 days in Paris and 2 days in London, with a total expense of $2310.</answer>"
