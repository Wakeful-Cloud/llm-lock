Now I need to calculate the minimum expense for a 5-day trip with different combinations of nights spent Paris and London.\n\nFor Paris (3 nights) and London (2 nights):\n- Hotel Eiffel Toureiffel: $450 * 3 = $1350\n- Hotel Mandara: $480 * 2 = $960\nTotal for Paris 3 nights & London 2 nights: $1350 + $960 = $2310\n\nFor Paris (2 nights) and London (3 nights):\n- Hotel Eiffel Toureiffel: $450 * 2 = $900\n- Hotel Mandara: $480 * 3 = $1440\nTotal for Paris 2 nights & London 3 nights: $900 + $1440 =$2340\n\nComparing the totals, I recommend staying in Paris for 3 nights and in London for 2 nights at a total of $2310.\n\nThe recommended hotels are Hotel Eiffel Toureiffel in Paris and Hotel Mandara in London. The minimal prices for each hotel are $450 per night and $480 per night respectively. The minimum expense for the 5-day trip is $2310.\n\n<answer>The recommended hotels are:\n- Paris: Hotel Eiffel Toureiffel ($450/night)\n- London: Hotel Mandara ($480/night)\n\nThe minimum expense for the 5-day trip, staying 3 nights in Paris and 2 nights in London, is $2310.</answer>"
