However, based on your request, I'll try to assist with the available tools.\n\nGiven that I don't have direct access to real-time flight information or a specific \"get_flight_information\" function, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving this problem.\n\nTo find flights from Paris to Lyon for the specified dates, you would typically:\n\n1. Identify departure and arrival airports (e.g., CDG or ORY for Paris, and LYS for Lyon).\n2. Use a flight search engine API or website like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or directly check airline websites.\n\nSince I can't execute external functions or access real-time data directly, let's assume you're looking for general information on how to find such flights:\n\n- **Departure City:** Paris (Consider airports CDG, ORY)\n- **Arrival City:** Lyon (LYS airport)\n\nFor actual flight details, including schedules and prices, you would typically visit a travel booking website or use an API if available.\n\nIf I had to provide a structured response based on standard practices:\n\n<function-thoughts>I don't have the capability to directly fetch real-time flight information.

You may also visit airline websites directly. Key airports to consider are CDG/ORY for Paris and LYS for Lyon.</answer>"
