I'll start by finding the best-rated car rental company in London.\n\nI will now find the best-rated restaurant in London.\n\nNext, I will find the most expensive hotel in London.\n\nNow, I'll gather similar information for Paris, starting with the best-rated car rental company.\n\nI will now find the best-rated restaurant in Paris.\n\nNext, I will find the most expensive hotel in Paris.\n\nI have all the information needed to calculate the total maximum expense for the 5-day trip. I'll now compute this based on the provided details: 2 days in London and 3 days in Paris, assuming 2 meals per day, and staying in the most expensive room at one of the hotels.\n\n<answer>Based on the information available, here are the recommendations:\n\nLondon:\n- Top-rated car rental company: Enterprise\n- Top-rated restaurant: Gordon Ramsay's Royal Hospital Road\n- Most expensive hotel: The Ritz London (approximately \u20ac1,500 per night)\n\nParis:\n- Top-rated car rental company: Sixt\n- Top-rated restaurant: Le Grand Vefour\n- Most expensive hotel: Hotel Bristol Paris (approximately \u20ac2,000 per night)\n\nTotal maximum expense calculation for 5 days (assuming 2 meals per day and the most expensive room at one of the hotels):\n- Accommodation:\n  - London (2 nights): 2 * \u20ac1,500 = \u20ac3,000\n  - Paris (3 nights): 3 * \u20ac2,000 = \u20ac6,000\n  Total accommodation: \u20ac9,000\n\n- Meals (assuming \u20ac100 per meal):\n  - London (4 meals): 4 * \u20ac100 = \u20ac400\n  - Paris (6 meals): 6 * \u20ac100 = \u20ac600\n  Total meals: \u20ac1,000\n\nGiven that car rental and restaurant prices weren't provided in the function calls, let's assume:\n- Car rental for 5 days (approximately): \u20ac500\n- Miscellaneous expenses (souvenirs, transportation between cities, etc.): \u20ac500\n\nTotal maximum expense for the 5-day trip: \n\u20ac9,000 (accommodation) + \u20ac1,000 (meals) + \u20ac500 (car rental) + \u20ac500 (miscellaneous) = \u20ac11,000\n\nPlease note that these estimates are based on hypothetical prices and may vary. For precise costs, I recommend checking current rates for car rentals, restaurants, and hotels.</answer>"
