For a 3-day rental, it would cost approximately $150 (50 * 3).\n\nFor your cousin's family, I recommend \"Big SUV Rentals\" with a rating of 4.8. For a 3-day rental, it would cost approximately $180 (60 * 3).\n\nSo, the two car rental company names and their ratings are:\n1. Green Wheels - 4.5\n2. Big SUV Rentals - 4.8\n\nThe 3-day rental costs are:\n1. Green Wheels: $150\n2. Big SUV Rentals: $180\n</answer>"
