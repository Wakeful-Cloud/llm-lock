Identify the top-rated car rental company that rents electric cars for my family.\n3. Identify the top-rated car rental company that has SUVs available for my cousin's family.\n4. Calculate the 3-day rental cost for each of the recommended companies.\n\nFirst, I will find all car rental companies in Los Angeles.\n\n<function-error>The function 'get_flight_information' is not suitable for this task. Please try again.</function-error>\nSince the function get_flight_information is irrelevant to our current needs, I'll search for car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars and provide ratings.\n\n<function-error>The tool does not exist. Try another approach.</function-error>\nSince the specific function to get car rental companies with electric cars doesn't exist, I'll start by searching for all car rental companies in Los Angeles and then filter based on ratings and availability of electric or SUV options.\n\n<function-error>The tool does not exist. Try another approach.</function-error>\nSince I don't have a direct function to get car rental companies, I'll try to find information about car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars and SUVs through general knowledge or available tools.\n\n<function-error>The tool does not exist. Try another approach.</function-error>\nSince direct functions are limited, I'll use a more general approach to gather information about car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric and SUV options, focusing on highly-rated ones.\n\n<function-error>The tool does not exist. Try another approach.</function-error>\nGiven the constraints, I'll need to use available functions creatively or provide general guidance based on typical car rental company characteristics in Los Angeles.\n\n<function-error>The tool does not exist. Try another approach.</function-error>\nI will now try to find information about electric and SUV options from well-known car rental companies in Los Angeles, and their ratings.\n\n<function-error>The tool does not exist. Try another function.</function-error>\nSince I cannot directly access specific functions to gather this information, I'll rely on general knowledge of car rental companies and their offerings in Los Angeles.\n\n<answer>I apologize for the confusion. Given the tools available, let's approach this with a more straightforward method.\n\nIn Los Angeles, some well-known car rental companies that offer electric vehicles (EVs) include:\n1. **Enterprise Rent-A-Car** - They have a wide range of vehicles, including electric and hybrid options.\n2. **Hertz** - Offers electric and hybrid cars in their fleet.\n3. **Avis** - Provides electric and hybrid vehicle options.\n\nFor SUVs:\n1. **National Car Rental** - Has a variety of SUV options available.\n2. **Sixt** - Offers a range of SUVs for rental.\n\nRatings can vary based on the source, but generally:\n- Enterprise Rent-A-Car has high ratings for its wide selection and customer service.\n- Hertz is well-rated for its diverse fleet.\n\nCosts for 3-day rentals can vary widely depending on the specific vehicle and time of year. Here are some estimates:\n- Electric car from Enterprise or Hertz: $150-$300 per day (Total: $450-$900)\n- SUV from National or Sixt: $100-$250 per day (Total: $300-$750)\n\nFor precise recommendations, I recommend checking current ratings on sites like Yelp or Google Reviews and costs directly on the companies' websites.\n\n**Recommended Companies:**\n1. **Enterprise Rent-A-Car** (High rating, Electric options)\n2. **National Car Rental** (Top-rated for SUVs)\n\n**Please Note:** These are general estimates and recommendations based on typical industry standards.</answer>"
