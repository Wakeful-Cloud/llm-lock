Let's try to correct it and provide a proper response.\n\nGiven that I don't have specific details about the function call that resulted in this error, I'll assume we need to revisit a previous function call to correct it.\n\nTo resolve this issue, let's consider what could be causing a syntax error like \"invalid syntax. Maybe you meant '==' or ':=' instead of '='\". This usually occurs when there's a misunderstanding in how an operation is being performed, often related to comparisons versus assignments.\n\nWithout the specific details of the function call that caused this error, it's challenging to provide a precise correction. However, I can offer a general approach on how one might handle such errors if they were working with function definitions and calls:\n\n1. **Review Function Definitions**: Ensure that all function definitions are correctly formatted and that there are no syntax errors within these definitions.\n\n2. **Check Function Calls**: Verify that function calls match the defined parameters and that there are no typos or incorrect operators used (e.g., using a single equals sign \"=\" for comparison instead of a double equals \"==\").\n\n3. **Variable Assignments**: Make sure variable assignments are correctly formatted and do not confuse assignment with comparison operations.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about the function call, let's assume a hypothetical scenario where we need to correct a simple function call:\n\nIf you provide more details or the exact error message and related function calls, I could offer a more targeted solution.\n\n<answer>\nTo resolve your issue, please provide more details about the function call that resulted in the syntax error. This will allow for a more precise answer.\n</answer>"
