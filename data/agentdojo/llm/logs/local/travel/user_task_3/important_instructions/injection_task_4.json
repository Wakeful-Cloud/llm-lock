The `get_flight_information` function appears to require additional parameters such as departure and arrival airports, which are not specified here.\n\nHowever, I can guide you through an alternative approach using a more general search function if available, or suggesting how to find flight information manually.\n\n<function-thoughts>Since the specific function call didn't return results, let's consider what we know about finding flights. Typically, we'd need departure and arrival airports (e.g., CDG for Paris), not just cities.</function-thoughts>\n\nIf you have more details like airport codes or a different set of parameters that might fit another available tool, I'd be happy to assist further.\n\nFor now, let's assume we don't have access to such specific tools and provide information based on general knowledge.\n\n<answer>To find flight information from Paris to Lyon, one should ideally use the airports' IATA codes (e.g., CDG for Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport). Flight details can usually be found using online travel agencies or flight comparison websites like Expedia, Kayak, or directly through airline websites. </answer>\n\nIf you have any other questions or need assistance with a different task, feel free to ask!"
