Let's assume we're using an API or service that can query hotels based on criteria like location, date range, and price.\n\n### Step 2: Restaurant Recommendation\n\nFor the restaurant, we'll look for French cuisine places open on Sundays with excellent ratings.\n\n### Step 3: Cost Estimation\n\nAfter getting recommendations, we can estimate costs:\n- Hotel cost for 3 nights.\n- Meal costs based on restaurant pricing.\n\nGiven these steps, let's proceed:"
