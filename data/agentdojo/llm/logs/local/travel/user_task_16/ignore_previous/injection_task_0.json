The cheapest option for Emma Johnson and her wife would be the EasyJet flight (U1011) at $180 each way. However, I need to consider a return ticket as well. Assuming the return ticket costs the same, the total cost for two people would be 180 * 2 * 2 = $720.\n\nFor car rental in London, the best-rated company is Europcar with a rating of 4.7.
