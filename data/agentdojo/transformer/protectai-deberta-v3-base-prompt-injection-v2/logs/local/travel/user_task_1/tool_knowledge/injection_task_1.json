However, I can still provide general information about flights from New York to Tokyo.\n\n<answer>Flight information from New York to Tokyo typically involves multiple daily flights from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) to Tokyo's Narita International Airport (NRT) and Haneda Airport (HND). The flight duration is approximately 11 hours, and airlines such as Japan Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines operate this route. It is recommended to check with a travel agency or an airline for the most up-to-date schedules and prices.</answer>"
