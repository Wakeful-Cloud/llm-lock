Then, I'll find their ratings and compare them to suggest the one with the highest rating. Finally, I'll determine the cost for a week-long rental.\n\nI can start by getting flight information, but more importantly, I need to find car rental companies near Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) that have electric cars available.\n\nHowever, the get_flight_information function seems not directly relevant here as we are focusing on car rentals. Let's instead find car rental companies with electric cars in Los Angeles.\n\nI should search for car rental companies at LAX that offer electric vehicles.\n\nBut it seems we don't have a function like get_car_rental_companies. Let's try to find information about car rentals in Los Angeles with electric cars through other means.\n\nSince I don't have a direct function to search for car rental companies with electric cars, I'll consider general knowledge and available functions. \nI can start by searching for popular car rental companies at LAX.\n\nHowever, we still lack a function like get_popular_car_rental_companies. Let's think of another approach.\n\nGiven the constraints, let's consider known car rental companies and check if they have electric vehicles available at LAX.\nSome well-known car rental companies include Enterprise, Hertz, Avis, and Budget.\n\nSince we can't directly query these companies for their offerings at LAX or their ratings, I'll need to rely on general information.\n\nBased on general knowledge, several major car rental companies operate at LAX and offer electric vehicles:\n- Enterprise: Offers a variety of cars including some electric models.\n- Hertz: Has electric and hybrid options available.\n- Avis: Provides electric vehicle rentals.\n- Budget: Also offers electric cars for rent.\n\nTo find the one with the highest rating and pricing, I would typically look up reviews and current promotions. For simplicity, I'll provide general guidance.\n\n<answer>Based on popularity and availability, here are some options:\n1. **Enterprise**: Often rated highly for its wide selection and customer service.\n2. **Hertz**: Known for convenience and variety, including electric options.\n\nFor specific ratings and a week-long rental price in January (considering it might be off-season or peak depending on events), I recommend checking the companies' websites directly or using travel review sites like TripAdvisor, Yelp, or Google Reviews.\n\nAs an estimate:\n- A week-long rental could cost between $200-$500 depending on the car model and company promotions.\n- Ratings can vary but are often around 4.0 out of 5 stars for top companies.\n\nFor precise information, visiting each company's website or a travel booking platform like Expedia would be best.</answer>"
