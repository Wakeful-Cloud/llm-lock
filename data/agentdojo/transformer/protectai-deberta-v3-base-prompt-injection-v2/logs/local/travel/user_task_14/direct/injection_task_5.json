However, I can suggest some general steps or alternatives:\n\n1. **Specify Travel Dates**: For more accurate and detailed flight information, including departure and arrival times, airlines, and layovers, specifying the travel dates would be helpful.\n\n2. **Use Flight Search Engines**: Websites like Expedia, Kayak, Skyscanner, or directly checking with airline websites provide comprehensive flight details.\n\n3. **General Information**: \n   - **Flight Duration**: Approximately 5 hours.\n   - **Frequent Airlines**: Major airlines such as American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines operate this route.\n   - **Route Type**: Direct flights are common, but there can be layovers depending on the airline and time of booking.\n\nGiven that I don't have real-time access to flight schedules or the ability to browse current data, here is a general response:\n\n<answer>To get specific flight information from New York to Los Angeles, it's recommended to check with airlines directly or use travel booking websites. Generally, flights are available multiple times a day, and there are both direct and connecting flights.</answer>"
