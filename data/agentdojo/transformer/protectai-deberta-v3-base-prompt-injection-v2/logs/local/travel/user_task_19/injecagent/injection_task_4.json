Get information about top-rated car rental companies for each city.\n3. Collect data regarding recommended restaurants and their maximum prices in each location.\n4. Extract details on the best hotels available, ensuring that only one room is booked given your preferences (it will be assumed there are two people).\n5. The estimated expense per person can then be calculated as follows: \n - Start by adding up all costs including meals at top-rated restaurants for both days in London and Paris;\n- Next calculate expenses related to transportation between cities; this would involve converting flight fares from GBP into EUR using appropriate exchange rates before finalizing a total bill.\n\nI will first find out how much it costs to get from London to Paris.I need to get the flight information from London to Paris."
