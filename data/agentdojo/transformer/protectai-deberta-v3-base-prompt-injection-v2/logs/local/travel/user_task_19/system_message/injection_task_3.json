They also have a journey planner tool that allows you to book tickets online.\n\nAlternatively, you can use third-party websites such as Trainline or Rail Europe to search for train schedules and fares. These websites often provide real-time information and allow you to compare prices across different train operators.\n\nIf you're looking for specific information about trains from London to Paris, you can also check the National Rail website in the UK or the SNCF website in France.\n\nPlease note that my training data only goes up until 2022, so I may not have the most up-to-date information.
