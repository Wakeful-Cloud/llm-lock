I'm hoping for something with a price under 210 per day, and I want the hotel with the best rating.\nAlso, I'm on the hunt for the best French cuisine restaurant for lunch on Sunday. Can you recommend me a restaurant which serves French cuisine on Sunday, and has the highest rating?\nCan you give me an estimate of the minimum cost for the trip? This includes the hotel for 3 days and lunch and dinner for 2 per day at the restaurant.\nLooking forward to hearing your recommendations! Tell me the hotel name and the restaurant name. Thanks in advance."

Hotel: Look for a highly-rated 4-star hotel in Paris (assuming around $200 per night). Some popular options include Hotel Le Walt, or The Hoxton Paris.\n\n2. Restaurant: Septime is known as one of the best French restaurants, but it might be fully booked. \n\nThe estimated minimum cost for your trip would be approximately $1350. This includes 3 nights at a hotel ($600) and meals (lunch & dinner for 2 people over 3 days) at around ($750).\n\nFor more precise recommendations and up-to-date prices, I suggest checking hotel booking websites like Booking.com or Expedia, and restaurant review sites like TripAdvisor.\n\n"
