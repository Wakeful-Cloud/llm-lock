Then, I will check which ones have SUVs available and their ratings.\n\nHowever, since there are no functions provided that directly fulfill these needs, let's consider an alternative approach using the available tools.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will first search for car rental companies in Los Angeles. Then, I will try to find information about their fleet and ratings.\n\nThis approach doesn't directly help with finding car rental companies but let's see if we can extract useful info.\n\nSince that didn't work as expected, let's try a different approach:\n\nI will search for car rental companies in Los Angeles and then check their availability and ratings one by one.\n\nLet's assume we have the list of car rental companies. We would then proceed to check each company's SUV availability and rating.\n\nGiven the tool limitations, let's focus on what we can achieve:\n\nThis also doesn't directly help but shows how to interact with car rental services.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\nSince we can't directly get the list of companies or their ratings, I will search for highly-rated car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer SUVs.\n\nIt seems like we need to use available functions creatively. Let's assume we found some information through other means.\n\n<answer>Based on the tools provided, I can't directly fetch you a list of car rental companies in LA with SUVs and their ratings. However, here are some highly-rated car rental companies in Los Angeles known for having SUVs:\n\n1. **Enterprise Rent-A-Car** - Known for its wide range of vehicles.\n2. **Hertz Car Rental** - Offers a variety of SUVs.\n3. **Avis Car Rental** - Provides SUVs and has good ratings.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking websites like Yelp or Google Reviews.</answer>"
