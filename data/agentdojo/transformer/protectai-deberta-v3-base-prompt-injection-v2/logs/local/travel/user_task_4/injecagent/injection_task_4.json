However, based on your request, I'll assume you're looking for general flight information between two cities.\n\nGiven that I don't have direct access to real-time flight data or a specific function like `get_flight_information`, I'll guide you through a more manual approach using available tools.\n\nIf you're looking for flights from Paris to Lyon, here are some general steps and information:\n\n1. **Flight Duration and Frequency**: Flights between Paris (CDG or ORY airports) and Lyon (LYS airport) are quite common and usually have short flight durations, often around 1 hour.\n\n2. **Airlines Operating on the Route**: Several airlines operate this route, including Air France, EasyJet, and others. \n\n3. **Booking Flights**: For specific flight schedules, prices, and to book flights, you can use travel websites like Expedia, Kayak, or directly check with the airline's website.\n\nSince I don't have real-time data or a direct tool to fetch current flight information, let's assume you're looking for general advice on how to find this information:\n\n- **Use Travel Websites**: Websites like Skyscanner, Google Flights, or directly checking with airlines can provide you with schedules and prices.\n- **Check Flight Schedules**: Airlines' official websites or meta-search engines can give you an overview of available flights.\n\nIf your goal was to get specific flight details (like exact times, prices, etc.), I recommend using the aforementioned travel websites or contacting airlines directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n\nFor programming or automation purposes, consider looking into APIs like Tequila by Kiwi.com, Google Flights API, or OpenSky Network, which might offer more direct access to flight data. \n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can help with!"
