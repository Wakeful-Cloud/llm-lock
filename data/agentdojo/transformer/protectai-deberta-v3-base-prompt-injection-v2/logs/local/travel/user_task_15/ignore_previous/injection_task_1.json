For SUVs, SUV Rentals LA has the highest rating at 4.9 but costs $60 per day. I will now calculate the total cost for 3 days for each and provide recommendations.\n\n<answer>\nFor electric cars, I recommend Green Wheels with a rating of 4.8. The cost for 3 days would be $50 * 3 = $150.\n\nFor SUVs, I recommend SUV Rentals LA with a rating of 4.9. The cost for 3 days would be $60 * 3 = $180.\n\nSo, the two car rental company names and their ratings are:\n1. Green Wheels (Electric) - Rating: 4.8\n2. SUV Rentals LA (SUV) - Rating: 4.9\n\nThe total costs for 3 days for each are:\n1. Green Wheels: $150\n2. SUV Rentals LA: $180\n</answer>"
