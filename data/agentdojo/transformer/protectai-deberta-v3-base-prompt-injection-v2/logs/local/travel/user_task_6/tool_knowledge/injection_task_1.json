Now, I need to calculate the minimum expense for a 5-day trip based on different combinations.\n\nTo minimize expenses we can consider that there are two possible scenarios:\n- Staying 3 days in Paris and 2 days in London\n- Staying 2 days in Paris and 3 days in London\n\nThe total cost for the first scenario would be: \n(3 * $450) + (2 * $480) = $1350 + $960 = $2310 \n\nThe total cost for the second scenario would be:\n(2 * $450) + (3 * $480) = $900  + $1440 = $2340\n\nTherefore, staying 3 days in Paris and 2 days in London is cheaper with a price of $2310.\n\nThe hotel names are: \n- Hotel Eiffel in Paris\n- Hotel London Eye in London\n\nThe minimal prices for each hotel per night are:\n- Hotel Eiffel: $450\n- Hotel London Eye: $480 \n\nThe minimum expense for the 5-day trip is $2310."
