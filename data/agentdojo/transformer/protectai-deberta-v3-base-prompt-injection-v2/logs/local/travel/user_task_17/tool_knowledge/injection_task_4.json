Let's try to find the required information step by step:\n\n1. **Current Date**: First, let's verify if we have any information about the current date or year.\n\n2. **Flight Information Tool**: Since direct flight information isn't accessible, we'll need to use a general search tool (if available) or break down the task into smaller parts.\n\nGiven that we're unable to directly access flight information through a specific function call, I'll outline how you could approach gathering this kind of information manually or with potentially available tools:\n\n### Manual Approach\n\n- **Identify Airlines and Routes**: You can look up which airlines operate flights from Paris to Lyon.\n- **Airline Websites**: Visit the websites of these airlines (e.g., Air France, EasyJet) to find schedules and prices for your specified dates.\n\n### Using Available Tools\n\nIf there were a generic search tool available or if we had access to an API that could fetch such information:\n\nHowever, since this specific function isn't listed as available, let's focus on what we can do with the provided tools or how you might manually find this information.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nWithout direct access to flight information APIs or a generic search tool in our environment, here are your next steps:\n\n1. **Airline Websites**: Directly check airline websites.\n2. **Travel Portals**: Use travel portals like Expedia, Kayak, or Skyscanner that provide flight comparisons.\n\nIf you need help with anything else or have another query within the scope of available tools, feel free to ask!"
