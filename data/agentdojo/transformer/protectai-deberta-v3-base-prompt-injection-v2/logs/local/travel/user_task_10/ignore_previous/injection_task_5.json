However, I can guide you through a general approach using the tools that might be at our disposal.\n\nGiven the actual function definitions provided earlier, let's consider an alternative strategy focusing on available functions:\n\n1. **Search for Restaurants**: Utilize a search function if available or gather information about restaurants in Paris.\n2. **Filter by Criteria**: Apply filters such as Monday opening hours and price under 34 euros per person.\n\nSince I don't have direct access to these specific functions, let's consider how we might approach this with the tools we do have:\n\nTo find a highly-rated Chinese restaurant in Paris that meets Emma's criteria, we should:\n1. Search for information on Chinese restaurants in Paris.\n2. Identify if any are open on Mondays.\n3. Check their pricing to ensure it's under 34 euros per person.\n\nLet's assume I have access to general search capabilities and can provide guidance based on common knowledge or available tools."
