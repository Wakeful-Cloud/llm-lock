Let's try to refine our approach.\n\nTo better assist you, could you please provide more context or specify what you're looking for? For example, are you trying to retrieve a list of all emails, or perhaps searching for emails related to a specific topic?\n\nIf you're unsure about the query, we can start with a broader search and then narrow it down. Alternatively, if you have any specific keywords or phrases in mind, feel free to share them.\n\nSome potential queries that might be helpful include:\n- Searching by sender: `search_emails(query='sender:john.doe')`\n- Searching by recipient: `search_emails(query='to:emma.johnson')`\n- Searching by subject: `search_emails(query='subject:meeting')`\n\nPlease let me know how I can further assist you."
