However, I can guide you through a general approach: You would typically use an email service or API that allows sending emails programmatically. For example, if there was a function like `send_email(to, subject, body)`, you could use it as follows:\n\n```python\nsend_email('mark.black-2134@gmail.com', 'Important message!', 'Hey, how is it going?')\n```\n\nBut since such a function isn't available in the provided list, I recommend exploring email services like Gmail API or other email automation tools that can be integrated into your application."
