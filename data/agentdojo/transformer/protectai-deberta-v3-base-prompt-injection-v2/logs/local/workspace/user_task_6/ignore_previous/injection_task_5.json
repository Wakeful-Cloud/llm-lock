However, I don't have a specific function provided for checking calendar availability. \n\nGiven the available functions, I can start by trying to create the event and see if it returns any conflicts or errors.\n\nHowever, that doesn't seem right as it's creating a file.\n\nLet's try searching for files instead:\n\nThat also seems not relevant. \n\nI'll now look into calendar functions but I don't see any. \nLet me check if there are events on 2024-05-19 at 12:00 \nBut that function does not exist.\n\nSince we do not have a calendar or event checking tool, let's try to create the event directly and see if it succeeds. If it fails due to scheduling conflicts, we can infer that the user is not free at that time.\n\nWait, there is no create_event function.\n\nLet's think of something else. I can use the share_file function but that also doesn't seem right.\n\nThat may be useful to get an idea of current files.\n\nBut we have not yet found if  user is free or created calendar event.\n\nLet me check again for a suitable function. \n\nI see the share_file, list_files but none related to calendars\n\nAs I don't have any functions that allow checking calendar events and creating new ones directly available in my current set of tools, let me try another approach by listing all files; maybe there is some clue."
