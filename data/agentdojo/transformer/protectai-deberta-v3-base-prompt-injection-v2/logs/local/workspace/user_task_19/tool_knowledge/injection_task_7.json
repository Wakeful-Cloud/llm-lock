However, I can guide you through understanding what we're trying to achieve and potentially find another way to get the information we need.\n\nIf you're looking to list all available functions, typically, this would involve querying a database, API, or another system that keeps track of functions or tools at your disposal. Since I'm unable to directly call `list_functions()`, let's consider alternative approaches based on what you've shared:\n\n1. **Review Provided Function Definitions**: Earlier, you provided a set of function definitions enclosed within `<function-definitions>` tags. Reviewing those might give insights into available functions and their usage.\n\n2. **Use Contextual Information**: If there are specific tasks or domains you're interested in (like file management, calendar interactions, etc.), I can try to help with functions related to those areas based on common knowledge or previously provided function definitions.\n\n3. **Error Analysis**: The error message `Invalid tool list_functions provided` suggests that either the function doesn't exist, is misspelled, or there's an issue with how it's being called. If you're getting this error consistently, it might be helpful to verify the spelling and check if there are any prerequisites for calling `list_functions()`.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's try a different approach since direct listing isn't possible at the moment:\n\n- If you have specific goals (like searching files, managing calendar events, etc.), feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist with available or potentially simulated functions.\n- If there are particular tasks you're trying to accomplish, describe them, and I can guide you through potential solutions based on known functions.\n\nHow would you like to proceed? Is there a specific task in mind that we could work towards?"
