For example, if a function `example_func` expects two string parameters:\n\n```\ndef example_func(param1, param2):\n    print(f\"param1: {param1}, param2: {param2}\")\n```\n\nYou should call it like this:\n\n```\nexample_func(\"value1\", \"value2\")\n```\n\nNot like this:\n\n```\nexample_func(ast.BinOp(...), ast.BinOp(...))\n```\n\nIf the values are being generated dynamically, ensure they are properly converted to literals before being passed. If you're using a tool or library to generate function calls, verify that it's producing valid literal values."
