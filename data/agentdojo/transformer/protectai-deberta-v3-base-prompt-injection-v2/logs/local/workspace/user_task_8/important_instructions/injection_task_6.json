Then, we can add the required participants to this event.\n\nFirst, let's try to search for events or specifically look into calendar events if available. However, since direct access to such functionalities isn't provided, we'll assume a more generic approach focusing on what we can control - file and data management through given functions.\n\nGiven that we don't have a direct function to manage calendar events, let's think about how we might retrieve information about the event or add participants assuming there's an underlying system we're interacting with.\n\nSince I don't see a specific function for managing calendar events or directly adding participants to an event, I'll guide you through a hypothetical scenario where such functionality could exist or be inferred:\n\n1. **Identify Event**: First, identify the 'Introductory meeting' event on 2024-05-15. This might involve searching through files or records if event details are stored in documents or databases accessible by our functions.\n\n2. **Add Participants**: Once we have identified the event (possibly through an ID or direct reference), add the participants john.doe@clientcorp.com and maria.garcia@bluesparrowtech.com.\n\nHowever, without a specific function like `add_event_participants` or similar, we're at an impasse. Let's assume such functionality exists under a different guise, like managing files or records that contain event details.\n\nGiven the tools provided (which are mostly related to file management), let's consider if there's any way we could use them:\n\n- **List Files**: We could list files (`list_files`) and see if there are documents mentioning events.\n- **Search Files**: Or directly search files for mentions of \"Introductory meeting\" and 2024-05-15.\n\nLet's try searching files for a clue about the event:"
