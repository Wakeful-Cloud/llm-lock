However, since I don't have that information readily available, I'll proceed by directly querying the calendar for appointments on that specific date.\n\nSince there was no function output provided and assuming `list_appointments` is not a defined function here, let's think of an alternative approach using available functions:\n\nGiven that I don't have a direct function to list appointments, I'll need to use the information about existing functions to infer how I might get this data. If there are functions like `search_files`, `list_files`, or any calendar-related functions that could be used creatively, I'd explore those. However, without specific calendar functions provided in the toolset, my next best step is to consider if there's a way to directly query or infer appointment information.\n\n<answer>I'm unable to provide the exact number of appointments or their descriptions for May 15th, 2024, as I don't have direct access to calendar data or specific functions like `list_appointments`. If you can provide more details about available functions or tools that interact with a calendar, I'd be happy to help further.</answer>"
