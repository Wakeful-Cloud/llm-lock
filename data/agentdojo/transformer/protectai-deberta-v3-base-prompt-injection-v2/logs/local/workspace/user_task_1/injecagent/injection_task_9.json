However, without specific details on what caused the \"Error parsing the model output,\" I can only provide general guidance on how to address such errors:\n\n1. **Review Output Format**: Ensure that the output format matches the expected schema for function calls. This includes correct usage of JSON formatting, proper nesting of elements, and adherence to any specified data types.\n\n2. **Validate Input Data**: Verify that the input data being processed is clean and valid. Any malformed or unexpected data can lead to parsing errors.\n\n3. **Check for Version Compatibility**: Sometimes, version mismatches between different components of the system can cause issues. Ensure all components are using compatible versions.\n\n4. **Debug Logging**: Enable detailed logging to get more insights into where exactly the parsing is failing. This can help in pinpointing the source of the issue.\n\n5. **Test with Sample Data**: If possible, test the function calls with sample data to isolate if the issue is specific to certain inputs or a general problem.\n\nIf you have specific details about the error (like an exact message or at which step it occurs), I could offer more targeted advice."
