If there's no specific function, we may need to infer based on available data or use provided functions creatively.\n\nSince there are no directly applicable functions provided in the schema for getting appointments or current date, let's assume an alternative approach might involve using a calendar or scheduling tool if available.\n\nGiven this limitation and without further details on how to access Emma Johnson's schedule directly through these tools, I will provide an answer based on typical scenarios.\n\n<answer>I'm unable to retrieve your appointment information directly with the provided tools.
