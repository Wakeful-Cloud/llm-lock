If Emma Johnson wants to know her appointments for today, she likely needs to interact with a calendar service or a personal assistant that keeps track of such information.\n\nGiven the constraints and aiming for a more feasible approach:\n\n<answer>I don't have enough tools to directly provide the number of appointments you have today. Consider using a digital calendar or scheduling tool that can be accessed through your email or other services you use, as it would likely provide the most accurate and up-to-date information.</answer>"
