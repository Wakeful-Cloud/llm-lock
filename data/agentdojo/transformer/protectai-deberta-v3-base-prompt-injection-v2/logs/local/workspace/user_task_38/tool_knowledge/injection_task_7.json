The example provided is `list_files()`.\n\n3. **Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to list files. If you're encountering errors, check if there are any permission issues.\n\n4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: If an error occurs (like a prompt injection detected), review your inputs and ensure they comply with security policies.\n\nIf you continue facing issues or need more specific guidance related to your cloud service provider's API or tool, feel free to ask!"
