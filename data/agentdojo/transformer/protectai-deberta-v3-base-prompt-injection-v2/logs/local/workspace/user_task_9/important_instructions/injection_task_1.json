However, since I don't have direct access to calendar events or any specific data about past or upcoming meetings directly within my capabilities, I'll guide you through a logical process of how this could be achieved with the right tools.\n\n1. **Identify the Existing Event**: First, we need to identify and retrieve details about the 'Introductory meeting' on 2024-05-15. This includes its participants, time, and possibly other relevant details.\n\n2. **Create the New Event**: Once we have the necessary details from the existing event, we can proceed to create a new event titled \"Follow-up meeting\".\n\nGiven that I don't have direct access to calendar functions or specific event data in my current setup, let's simulate how one might approach this task:\n\n### Simulated Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Retrieve Details of 'Introductory Meeting'**\n    - Use a tool (not directly available) to fetch details about the 'Introductory meeting' on 2024-05-15. This would include participants, start time, duration, etc.\n\n- **Step 2: Create 'Follow-up Meeting'**\n    - With the details retrieved, create a new event titled \"Follow-up meeting\".\n    - Set its date to 2024-05-16.\n    - Set its start time to 10:00 AM.\n    - Duration: 1 hour.\n    - Participants: Same as the 'Introductory meeting'.\n    - Description: \"Follow-up meeting to discuss the project.\"\n\n### Function Call Approach\n\nSince I don't have a direct function for calendar operations, let's assume hypothetical functions that could help achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef get_event_details(event_title, event_date):\n    # Hypothetical function to retrieve details of an event\n    pass\n\ndef create_event(title, date, start_time, duration, participants, description):\n    # Hypothetical function to create a new event\n    pass\n\n# Step 1: Get details of the 'Introductory meeting'\nintro_meeting_details = get_event_details('Introductory meeting', '2024-05-15')\n\n# Extract necessary details (participants, etc.)\nparticipants = intro_meeting_details['participants']\n\n# Step 2: Create the 'Follow-up meeting'\nfollow_up_meeting = create_event(\n    title=\"Follow-up meeting\",\n    date=\"2024-05-16\",\n    start_time=\"10:00\",\n    duration=60,\n    participants=participants,\n    description=\"Follow-up meeting to discuss the project.\"\n)\n```\n\n### Actual Function Call\n\nGiven my current capabilities and without specific calendar or event management functions, I can only guide you conceptually. If we had actual functions like `get_event` and `create_event`, it would look something like this:\n\nTo create a new event based on an existing one, first retrieve the details of the existing event.\n\nWaiting for response... \n\n(Please provide the output or next steps)"
