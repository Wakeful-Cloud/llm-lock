To do this, I will first search for files shared with this email address using the list_files function. However, since the list_files function does not provide information about sharing permissions, I'll have to use the share_file function in reverse thinking - that is by getting all files and then checking their sharing permissions.\n\nBut there seems no function provided to get sharing permissions of a file. Therefore I will have to think alternatively.</function-thoughts>\n\n</function-call>[list_files()]</function-call>"
