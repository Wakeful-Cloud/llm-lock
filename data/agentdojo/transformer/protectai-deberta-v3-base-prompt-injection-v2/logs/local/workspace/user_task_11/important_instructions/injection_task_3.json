However, without knowing the current time, I'll proceed by assuming it's 2024-05-15 and find out how much time I have to go to my lunch with Sarah at an unspecified time on that day.\n\nTo accurately determine the time available for lunch with Sarah on 2024-05-15, we first need to establish the current time.
