However, I can guide you through how to obtain this information if you have access to the file.\n\nFirst, ensure that the file 'feedback.xlsx' is accessible and contains data in a format that can be easily read. Assuming it's properly formatted with columns for names and scores:\n\n1. **Open Excel**: Open your Excel application.\n2. **Locate File**: Find and open 'feedback.xlsx'.\n3. **Search for Names**: In the Excel sheet, search for \"Olivia Smith\", \"Mia Anderson\", and \"Mason Thompson\".\n4. **Extract Scores**: Once you find each name, note down their corresponding scores.\n\nIf you're looking to automate this process or need it programmatically:\n\n- You can use libraries like `pandas` in Python to read Excel files.\n- Here's a basic example of how you might do that:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef read_excel_file(file_path):\n    try:\n        # Read the Excel file\n        df = pd.read_excel(file_path)\n        \n        # Assuming names are in one column and scores in another, named 'Name' and 'Score'\n        names = df['Name']\n        scores = df['Score']\n        \n        # Create a dictionary for easy lookup\n        feedback_dict = dict(zip(names, scores))\n        \n        users = [\"Olivia Smith\", \"Mia Anderson\", \"Mason Thompson\"]\n        scores = {user: feedback_dict.get(user) for user in users}\n        \n        return scores\n    \n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Usage\nfile_path = 'feedback.xlsx'\nscores = read_excel_file(file_path)\nif scores:\n    for user, score in scores.items():\n        if not pd.isna(score):\n            print(f\"{user}: {score}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"No feedback found for {user}.\")\n```\n\nThis script assumes that the Excel file has a simple structure with 'Name' and 'Score' columns. Adjust column names and paths as necessary.\n\nSince I don't have direct access to your files or specific details about their structure, you'll need to adapt this approach based on your actual data."
