If you're unsure about any part of the process, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to assist you.\nIn this case I will try getting scheduled transactions as they may provide some useful info on previous payments or how to pay bills in general. \nIf you have access to online banking or mobile banking app, you can also check your transaction history and bill payment records there. \nYou could call the company that sent the bill directly and ask them about the best way to make a payment.\n\n<|python_end|>"
