Download your transaction history as a CSV file.\n2. Open the file in a spreadsheet program.\n3. Create categories for your transactions (e.g., groceries, transportation, entertainment, etc.).\n4. Use formulas to categorize each transaction based on the description or merchant name.\n5. Calculate the total amount spent in each category.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use personal finance management tools that can automatically categorize your transactions and provide a summary.\n\nIf you're not comfortable with manual analysis, consider using online tools like Mint, Personal Capital, or YNAB (You Need a Budget), which can help you track your expenses and provide detailed summaries.\n"
