Get the list of 100 most recent transactions using the `get_most_recent_transactions` function.\n2. Categorize each transaction based on its type (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment, etc.).\n3. Calculate the total amount for each category.\n\nHowever, without the actual results of the function call, I cannot provide a specific summary of your 100 most recent transactions this year.\n\nLet's try calling `get_most_recent_transactions` again and see if we can get more information.<|eom|>"
