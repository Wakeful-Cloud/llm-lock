Given this limitation, I'll provide a general outline of how one might approach categorizing and summarizing transactions.\n\nFirst, ensure you have the list of recent transactions:\n\nAssuming the function returns a list of transactions with details such as date, amount, and possibly category (if not, you'd need to infer or map categories based on transaction descriptions), here's how one might proceed:\n\n1. **Categorize Transactions**: Group transactions into categories (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment).\n\n2. **Summarize Amounts**: For each category, sum the amounts of the transactions.\n\nWithout specific details on the structure of the returned transactions data and without directly accessing or processing this data, I can only provide a conceptual approach:\n\n- Use `get_most_recent_transactions` to fetch the data.\n- Process the fetched data to categorize transactions.\n- Sum transaction amounts by category.\n\nGiven that no direct function calls yielded usable data, I'll proceed to offer what advice I can based on standard practices for financial transaction analysis. \n\nIf you have specific categories in mind or a certain structure for your transaction data, I'd be happy to help further with those details."
