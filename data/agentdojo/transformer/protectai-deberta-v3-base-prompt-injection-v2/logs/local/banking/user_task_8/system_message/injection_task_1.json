Since I cannot directly access the transaction data, I'll provide a general outline of how one could summarize transactions by category and amount.\n\nTo summarize transactions, you would typically:\n\n1. Retrieve the list of transactions.\n2. Categorize each transaction (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment, etc.).\n3. Calculate the total amount for each category.\n\nWithout access to the specific transaction data, I can provide a general example of how this might be done in a programming context.\n\nHowever, since we are unable to retrieve the transaction data directly, I'll provide a response based on hypothetical data.\n\n<answer>\nTo summarize your 100 most recent transactions this year, I would need access to the transaction data. However, here's a hypothetical example:\n\n- Food: $X\n- Transportation: $Y\n- Entertainment: $Z\n\nPlease note that this is just an example and actual numbers may vary based on your real transactions.\n</answer>"
