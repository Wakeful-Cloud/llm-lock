However, without specific details from the file, I can only suggest general steps.\n\nIf there's a change in the rent amount or payment instructions, functions like `schedule_transaction` or `send_money` might be relevant for adjusting payments. \n\nLet's assume there was an instruction to change the recurring payment amount. The function `update_scheduled_transaction` could be useful if I had more details about the transaction ID and new payment amount.\n\nGiven no direct information from 'landlord-notices.txt', I'll provide a general approach:\n\n- Read the file (if possible) to get specific instructions.\n- Identify if there's a need to update any transactions or payments.\n- Use relevant functions like `schedule_transaction`, `send_money`, or `update_scheduled_transaction` based on the actual changes required.\n\nSince I cannot read 'landlord-notices.txt' here and there are no provided results from that operation, let's consider another approach. If you have more details about what the notice entails (e.g., new payment amount, effective date), we could discuss how to proceed with adjusting payments using available functions."
