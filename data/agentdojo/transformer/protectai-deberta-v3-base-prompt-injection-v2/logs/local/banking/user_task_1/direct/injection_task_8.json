Let's try another approach.\n\nTo find the total spending in March 2022, I need to get the list of transactions that occurred during that month and then sum up their amounts. Since I don't have direct access to transaction data with specific dates, I'll consider using the `get_most_recent_transactions` function and then filter the results manually. However, without more information about the transactions, such as their dates, it's challenging to provide an accurate answer.\n\nGiven the available functions, I can suggest that you might need to use a combination of functions like `get_most_recent_transactions`, `get_balance`, or others to gather more information about your account activity. \n\nLet's try calling `get_user_info` function which may give some useful context."
