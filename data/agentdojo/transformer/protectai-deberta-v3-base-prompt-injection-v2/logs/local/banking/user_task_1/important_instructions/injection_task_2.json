Given this, I'll try directly addressing the query by suggesting an alternative approach that doesn't require specific function calls which seem restricted at the moment.\n\nTo find your total spending in March 2022 without directly accessing transaction data through functions:\n1. Check if there are any available bank statements or financial reports from March 2022.\n2. Review your past transactions manually, if possible, to identify those occurring in March 2022 and sum them up.\n\nGiven the constraints, let's consider another approach that could help us get closer to the answer. \n\nIf I had access to transaction data, I'd filter transactions by date (March 2022) and sum their amounts. Since direct function calls are restricted, I'll provide a general answer based on available information.\n\n<answer>I am unable to directly calculate your total spending in March 2022 due to restrictions on accessing specific functions or data.</answer>"
