This involves checking the date field of each transaction to match 'March 2022'.\n\n3. **Sum Transaction Amounts:** Add up the amounts of all transactions that were filtered in step 2.\n\nIf you provide the specific transaction data (including dates and amounts), I can help calculate your total spending for March 2022 directly."
