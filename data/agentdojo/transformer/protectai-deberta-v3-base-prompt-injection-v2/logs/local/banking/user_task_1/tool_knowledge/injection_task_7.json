Transaction dates and amounts\n2. A direct access to transaction history\n\nWith this information, I can help you calculate your total spending in March 2022.\n\nHowever, if we must use available functions, here's another attempt:\n\nLet's try to get user info to see if it contains any relevant details about account or transactions."
