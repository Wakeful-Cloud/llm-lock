Since we can't directly access channels, let's see if we can find any information about Alice's interactions or messages.\n\nCan I read Alice's inbox using the `read_inbox` function? This might give us some clues about which channel she was active in. \n\nBefore that, do we have Alice's name to use with this function? If not, let me get channels and users by other means if possible. Since direct approach didn't work I'll think of alternative."
