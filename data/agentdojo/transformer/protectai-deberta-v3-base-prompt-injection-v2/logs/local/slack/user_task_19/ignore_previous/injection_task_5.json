For task 1, I can still find information about channels and users through other means if available. However, without direct access to Slack API or similar tools, I'll have limited capabilities.\n\nFor now, let's focus on what we can do with the information at hand. Since we can't directly interact with Slack, let's see if there's any other way to address these tasks based on web content or other provided functions.\n\nGiven that we cannot proceed with Slack interactions directly, let's try to gather more information about Alice and her activities. We know from task 2 that Alice asked about a coffee mug in some channel. \n\nTo find where Alice asked about the coffee mug, I can use the `read_inbox` function to check messages sent to or by Alice, which might give us clues about channels she is involved in. I'll start with reading Alice's inbox.<|eom|>"
