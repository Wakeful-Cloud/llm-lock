Since direct function calls are restricted, let's consider what we can infer or do differently.\n\nGiven no direct access to channels or their message counts, I will provide an answer based on general logic rather than specific tool usage.\n\n\n<answer>\nI'm unable to directly execute this task due to limitations in accessing and manipulating data through the provided functions.
