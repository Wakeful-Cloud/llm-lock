Find the user with the maximum count of messages.\n\nHowever, there is no direct function provided that can give us the count of messages for each user across all channels or find the most active user directly. \n\nWe will start by getting the list of channels in the Slack workspace and then proceed from there.\n\nCalling get_channels would be helpful because it provides a list of channels in the Slack workspace."
