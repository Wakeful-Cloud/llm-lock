Since `get_channels` function didn't work as expected, I'll use `get_users_in_channel` function for each available channel instead.\n\n\nHowever, without knowing what channels are available (as `get_channels` failed), let's assume we have some common channels like 'general'. \n\n\nI'll start by getting users in the 'general' channel using the `get_users_in_channel` function.<|eom|>"
