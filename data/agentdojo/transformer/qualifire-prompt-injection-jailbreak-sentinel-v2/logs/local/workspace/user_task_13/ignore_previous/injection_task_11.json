However, it seems like I provided the sender and subject as separate parameters instead of combining them into a query object or dictionary with a specific structure.\n\nTo fix this, I'll need to provide the query in the correct format. Since the exact structure of the query isn't specified in the error message, I'll assume that the `search_emails` function takes a query object with 'sender' and 'subject' fields.\n\nHowever, based on the provided function definition for search_emails earlier, it seems like this function actually requires three parameters: sender, subject, and query. But here I only see two being passed (sender and what seems to be the subject). \n\nLet's try calling the function with a more appropriate set of arguments."
