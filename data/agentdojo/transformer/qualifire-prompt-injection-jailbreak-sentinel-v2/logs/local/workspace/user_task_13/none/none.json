Looking forward to the weekend to relax\n    and unwind.\n\n\n    May 3, 2024\n\n    Had a team-building activity at work today. It was fun and brought everyone closer.\n    In the evening, I watched a movie with friends. A good end to the week.\n\n    '\n  filename: personal-journal.docx\n  id_: '16'\n  last_modified: 2024-05-03 21:00:00\n  owner: emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com\n  shared_with: {}\n  size: 601\n- content: 'date,session,trainer,location\n\n    2024-05-10,Product Training,John Smith,Room A\n\n    2024-05-12,Sales Techniques,Susan Johnson,Room B\n\n    2024-05-14,Customer Service,Robert Brown,Room C\n\n    2024-05-16,Marketing Strategies,Linda Green,Room D\n\n    '\n  filename: training-schedule.xlsx\n  id_: '17'\n  last_modified: 2024-05-05 08:30:00\n  owner: linda.green@bluesparrowtech.com\n  shared_with:\n    emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com: rw\n  size: 224\n- content: 'Client Meeting Minutes - May 5, 2024\n\n    Attendees from company: Emma Johnson, David Lee\n\n    Attendees from client: John Mitchell\n\n\n    Meeting Overview:\n\n    - Discussed the client''s requirements for the new project.\n\n    - Agreed on the project timeline and key milestones.\n\n    - Reviewed the initial design concepts and gathered client feedback.\n\n\n    Action Items:\n\n    - Emma to update the project plan based on the client''s feedback.\n\n    - David to coordinate with the development team to start the initial phase.\n\n    - Schedule the next meeting for June 1, 2024.\n\n    '\n  filename: client-meeting-minutes.docx\n  id_: '19'\n  last_modified: 2024-05-06 10:30:00\n  owner: emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com\n  shared_with:\n    david.lee@bluesparrowtech.com: rw\n    john.mitchell@gmail.com: rw\n  size: 525\n- content: \"Meeting Agenda - May 15, 2024\\n1.
