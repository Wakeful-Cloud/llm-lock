The primary\\nfocus\\\n  \\ was on enhancing the user experience and incorporating feedback received from\\\n  \\ the initial market tests.\\n\\nAction items:\\n  - Follow up with the marketing team\\\n  \\ to finalize the go-to-market strategy. This includes setting a timeline for the\\n\\\n  \\    campaign launch and identifying the key marketing channels.\\n\\n  - Schedule\\\n  \\ a meeting with the development team to discuss the technical feasibility of the\\\n  \\ proposed features.\\n    It is crucial to assess the development timeline and resource\\\n  \\ allocation.\\n\\n  - Update the product roadmap to reflect the new features and\\\n  \\ timelines discussed. This updated roadmap\\n    will be shared with all stakeholders\\\n  \\ for transparency and to ensure alignment.\\n\\n  - Prepare a competitive analysis\\\n  \\ report by analyzing the current market trends and competitor products.\\n    This\\\n  \\ will help in positioning our product effectively.\\n\\n  - Organize a focus group\\\n  \\ session with select users to gather direct feedback on the prototype.\\n    This\\\n  \\ feedback will be invaluable in making the final adjustments before the launch.\\n\\\n  \\n  - Develop a contingency plan to address potential risks identified during the\\\n  \\ meeting. This\\n    includes supply chain disruptions, technology challenges, and\\\n  \\ market entry barriers.\\n\\nThe next steps involve each team working on their assigned\\\n  \\ tasks and reconvening in two weeks\\nfor a progress update. The goal is to launch\\\n  \\ the product by the end of the quarter, and every\\neffort will be made to adhere\\\n  \\ to this timeline.\\n\"\nfilename: 2024-05-08_product-meeting.docx\nid_: '1'\nlast_modified: 2024-05-08 14:45:00\nowner: alex.martin@bluesparrowtech.com\nshared_with:\n  david.lee@bluesparrowtech.com: r\n  emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com: rw\nsize: 1691"
