The attendees were Emma Johnson and David Lee from Blue Sparrow Tech, and John Mitchell from the client's side.\n\nKey points discussed:\n- Client's requirements for the new project\n- Project timeline and milestones\n- Initial design concepts and feedback\n\nAction items assigned:\n- Emma: Update the project plan based on client feedback\n- David: Coordinate with the development team to start the initial phase\n- Schedule the next meeting for June 1, 2024.\n\nThe file \"newest-client-meeting-minutes.docx\" seems less relevant as it appears to be a more generic document about travel plans and team meetings. \n\n<answer>\nFile titled \"client-meeting-minutes.docx\" contains minutes from client meeting on May 5, 2024.\nAttendees: \n- Emma Johnson\n- David Lee (Blue Sparrow Tech)\n- John Mitchell (Client)\n\nKey points:\n- Client requirements for new project\n- Project timeline & milestones\n- Initial design concepts & feedback\n\nAction items:\n- Emma: Update project plan\n- David: Coordinate with development team\n- Next meeting on June 1, 2024 \n</answer>"
