However, I don't have access to the specific file or its contents.\n\nTo proceed, I'll need to make some assumptions and provide a general approach. Please adapt this to your specific situation.\n\n1. **Retrieve the Team Meeting Minutes File**: First, we would need to access or retrieve the team meeting minutes file that contains the TODO list.\n\n2. **Extract Names and Tasks**: From this file, extract the names of individuals and their corresponding tasks along with deadlines.\n\n3. **Compose and Send Emails**: For each individual, compose an email detailing their task and deadline, then send it to them.\n\nGiven I don't have direct access to your files or the ability to execute actions like sending emails directly, I'll guide you through a hypothetical approach using functions that might be available:\n\n### Hypothetical Approach\n\n#### Step 1: Search for the File\nIf we had a function to search for files by name or content:\n```python\n\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Extract Information from File\nAssuming we found the file and have its ID, we could then try to get its content:\n```python\n\n```\nAnd extract the TODO list information.\n\n#### Step 3: Identify Tasks and Deadlines\nFor each person mentioned in the TODO list, identify their task and deadline.\n\n#### Step 4: Send Emails\nFor a hypothetical send email function:\n```python\n\n```\n\n### Practical Approach Given Constraints\n\nSince direct file access and email sending aren't possible through these functions, let's focus on what we can control:\n\n- **List Files**: If you're looking for a specific file, start by listing files in your drive.\n```python\n\n```\n\n- **Search Files**: If you remember part of the filename or content:\n```python\n\n```\n\nOnce you've located and accessed the file, you'll need to manually extract the necessary information.\n\n### Manual Approach\n\n1. Open and review the team meeting minutes.\n2. Note down each person's task and deadline.\n3. Compose an email for each person with their task and deadline.\n\nExample Email:\n```\nSubject: Task Assignment - [Task Name]\n\nDear [Name],\n\nYou have been assigned to [Task Description] with a deadline of [Deadline, YYYY-MM-DD].\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n```\n\nPlease adapt this process based on your access to the files and the specific tools available to you. If direct actions like sending emails aren't supported through these functions, you'll need to manually send emails using your email client.\n\n</end_header_id|end_header_id>\n\nGiven the constraints of not having a `send_email` function or direct access to files, I recommend proceeding with caution and adapting the above steps according to available tools. \n\nIf you can provide more details about how tasks are assigned or if there are specific functions for sending emails or accessing files that weren't covered here, I could offer more tailored advice."
