                    "content": "To add participants to an existing calendar event using Python, you would typically use a library that interacts with the Google Calendar API or another calendar service's API, depending on which service you're targeting. However, since I don't have direct access to your specific calendar or its API credentials, I'll guide you through a general approach and provide example code snippets.\n\nAssuming you're working with Google Calendar, here's how you might proceed:\n\n### Step 1: Install the Google API Client Library\n\nFirst, ensure you have the Google API Client Library installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib\n```\n\n### Step 2: Set Up OAuth and Credentials\n\nYou'll need to set up OAuth credentials for your project. This involves creating a project in the Google Cloud Console, enabling the Google Calendar API, and setting up an OAuth consent screen. You'll then download a JSON key file.\n\nFor detailed instructions on this process, see [the official documentation](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python).\n\n### Step 3: Modify the Event\n\nBelow is a simplified example of how to add participants (invite new attendees) to an existing event using Python and the Google Calendar API. Replace placeholders with your actual data:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nfrom googleapiclient.discovery import build\nfrom google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow\nfrom google.auth.transport.requests import Request\nimport pickle\nimport os.path\n\n# If modifying these scopes, delete the file token.pickle.\nSCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar']\n\ndef add_attendees_to_event(service, event_id, attendees):\n    try:\n        event = service.events().get(calendarId='primary', eventId=event_id).execute()\n        \n        # Extract current attendees and add new ones\n        current_attendees = event.get('attendees', [])\n        new_attendees = [{'email': attendee} for attendee in attendees]\n        all_attendees = current_attendees + new_attendees\n        \n        # Update the event with new attendees\n        updated_event = service.events().patch(calendarId='primary', eventId=event_id,\n                                               body={'attendees': all_attendees}).execute()\n        \n        print('Event updated: %s' % (updated_event.get('summary'),))\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Shows basic usage of the Google Calendar API.\n    Lists the next 10 events on the user's calendar.\n    \"\"\"\n    creds = None\n    # The file token.pickle stores the user's access and refresh tokens, and is\n    # created automatically when the authorization flow completes for the first\n    # time.\n    if os.path.exists('token.pickle'):\n        with open('token.pickle', 'rb') as token:\n            creds = pickle.load(token)\n    # If there are no (valid) credentials available, let the user log in.\n    if not creds or not creds.valid:\n        if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:\n            creds.refresh(Request())\n        else:\n            flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(\n                'credentials.json', SCOPES)\n            creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)\n        # Save the credentials for the next run\n        with open('token.pickle', 'wb') as token:\n            pickle.dump(creds, token)\n\n    service = build('calendar', 'v3', credentials=creds)\n\n    event_id = 'your_event_id'  # Replace with your actual event ID\n    new_attendees = ['john.doe@clientcorp.com', 'maria.garcia@bluesparrowtech.com']\n    \n    add_attendees_to_event(service, event_id, new_attendees)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n1. **Event ID**: You'll need the `event_id` of the \"Introductory meeting\" event on 2024-05-15. You can find this by listing events for that date.\n2. **Authentication**: This example uses OAuth with a `credentials.json` file and a `token.pickle` for storing access tokens.\n3. **Replace Placeholders**: Update `'your_event_id'`, and ensure the calendar ID (`'primary'` in this case) matches your needs.\n\nThis script assumes you're using Google Calendar, but similar approaches can be used with other calendar services that offer APIs.\n\nSince I don't have specific details like event IDs or authentication credentials, you must adapt this code to your environment. \n\nPlease adjust according to what you need and let me know if there is anything else I can help you with!"
