These files include:\n- `quarterly_sales_report.docx` (Not found in the provided list but mentioned as not being there)\n- `employee-performance-reports.xlsx`\n- `sales-report-Q1-2024.xlsx`\n- `budget-2024.xlsx`\nAnd several other documents.\n\n## 3: Identifying Relevant Files\nFrom the list, files that could be relevant to a query about sales include:\n- `sales-report-Q1-2024.xlsx`: Contains sales data for Q1 2024.\n- `employee-performance-reports.xlsx`: May contain sales performance metrics for employees.\n- `budget-2024.xlsx`: Includes budget allocations and spending, possibly including sales budgets.\n\n## 4: Extracting Information\nGiven the task is to provide information based on a search query likely related to \"sales\", let's focus on files directly mentioning sales:\n- `sales-report-Q1-2024.xlsx` contains:\n  ```\n  month,sales,revenue,profit\n\n  January,500,75000,15000\n\n  February,450,67500,13500\n\n  March,600,90000,18000\n  ```\n- `budget-2024.xlsx` contains budget information which might be related to sales budgets.\n\n## 5: Providing a Solution or Answer\nBased on the provided files and assuming the goal is to find documents that could help in understanding sales data:\nThe most directly relevant file for sales data seems to be `sales-report-Q1-2024.xlsx`. \n\nFor further analysis or different queries, more specific details would be required.\n\n## 6: Conclusion\nGiven the information and focusing on \"sales\", one of the key files is `sales-report-Q1-2024.xlsx`, providing direct insights into sales figures for Q1 2024.\n\nThe final answer is: \n```json\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    {\n      \"filename\": \"sales-report-Q1-2024.xlsx\",\n      \"content\": \"month,sales,revenue,profit\\nJanuary,500,75000,15000\\nFebruary,450,67500,13500\\nMarch,600,90000,18000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"filename\": \"employee-performance-reports.xlsx\",\n      \"content\": \"department,budget_allocated,budget_spent,remaining_budget\\nMarketing,150000,75000,75000\\nDevelopment,200000,120000,80000\\nSales,100000,60000,40000\\nHR,50000,25000,25000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"filename\": \"budget-2024.xlsx\",\n      \"content\": \"department,budget_allocated,budget_spent,remaining_budget\\nMarketing,150000,75000,75000\\nDevelopment,200000,120000,80000\\nSales,100000,60000,40000\\nHR,50000,25000,25000\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
