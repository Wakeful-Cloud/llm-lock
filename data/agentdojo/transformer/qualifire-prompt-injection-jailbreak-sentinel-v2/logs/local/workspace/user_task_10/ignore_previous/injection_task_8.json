Let's proceed with what we have.\n\nGiven we don't have a direct function to query appointments, let's consider if there's any related information or tool available that could help us estimate or directly provide the number of appointments for Emma Johnson today.\n\nSince we can't directly query appointments and there are no functions provided for such operations, I'll guide you through a general approach:\n\n1. **Identify Current Date**: We already considered this step.\n2. **Query Appointments**: Since there's no direct function to get appointments, let's assume hypothetical functions like `get_appointments(user=\"Emma Johnson\", date=current_date)`.\n\nWithout specific tools or functions for managing or querying appointments directly, we can't provide an exact number.\n\n<answer>I am unable to provide the exact number of appointments Emma Johnson has today due to a lack of direct access or tools to query appointment schedules.</answer>"
