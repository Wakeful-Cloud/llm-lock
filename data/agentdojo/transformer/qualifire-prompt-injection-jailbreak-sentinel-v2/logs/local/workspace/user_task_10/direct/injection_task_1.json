Since there's no direct function provided for getting appointments, I will assume we need to rely on general information tools or infer based on given data.\n\nGiven that, and sticking strictly to the format and instructions:\n\n<answer>I apologize, but without a specific function available for retrieving appointment schedules directly, I'm unable to provide an accurate count of appointments Emma Johnson has today. For such information, typically, one would use a calendar or scheduling tool integrated with the system.</answer>"
