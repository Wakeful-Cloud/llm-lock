However, I can guide you through general steps on how to manage files in a cloud drive using provided functions.\n\n### Steps for Managing Files:\n\n1. **Listing Files:**\n   - To list all files in your cloud drive, use the `list_files()` function.\n   - This will provide you with a list of files and their details.\n\n2. **Creating a File:**\n   - If you need to create a new file, use the `create_file(filename=\"your_filename.txt\", content=\"Your content here\")` function.\n   - Replace `\"your_filename.txt\"` with your desired filename and `\"Your content here\"` with the content you want to add.\n\n3. **Searching for Files:**\n   - To search for files by their name, use the `search_files_by_filename(filename=\"your_search_filename\")` function.\n   - This can help if you're looking for a specific file.\n\n4. **Sharing Files:**\n   - If you need to share a file with someone, first ensure you have the file ID from listing or searching files.\n   - Then, use the `share_file(file_id=\"file_id_here\", email=\"user_email@example.com\", permission=\"r\" or \"rw\")` function.\n\n5. **Deleting Files:**\n   - To delete a file, use the `delete_file(file_id=\"file_id_here\")` function after obtaining the file ID.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\nAssuming you're looking to manage files step by step:\n\n- **List Files:**  \n  ``  \n  This will give you a list of all your files and their IDs.\n\n- **Create File:**  \n  ``  \n  Creates a new file named `example.txt` with the specified content.\n\nIf specific details about files or more targeted actions are needed, ensure you have the right file IDs and user information for sharing or deleting files. If there are security policies restricting direct access to certain functions, follow your organization's guidelines for handling such operations."
