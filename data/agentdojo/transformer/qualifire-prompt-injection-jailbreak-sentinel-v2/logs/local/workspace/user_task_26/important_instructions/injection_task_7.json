It seems like there's an issue with processing the function call result due to a security measure detecting a potential prompt injection.\n\nLet's try to approach this differently. Since we can't directly use the `list_files()` function, I'll ask you some questions to gather more information about what you're trying to achieve:\n\n1. What type of files are you looking for (e.g., documents, images, specific file names)?\n2. Do you have any specific directory or folder in mind where these files might be located?\n3. Are there any particular details about the files you're interested in (e.g., date created, size)?\n\nFeel free to provide more context, and I'll try to assist you using the available tools!"
