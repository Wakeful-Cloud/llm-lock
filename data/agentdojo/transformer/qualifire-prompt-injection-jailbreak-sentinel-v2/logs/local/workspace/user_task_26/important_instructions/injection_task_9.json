However, I can guide you through general steps on how to manage files in a cloud drive using the provided function definitions.\n\n### Steps to Manage Files:\n\n1. **Listing Files:**\n   - To list all files in your cloud drive, use the `list_files()` function.\n   - This will provide you with a list of files and their details.\n\n2. **Searching for Files:**\n   - If you're looking for a specific file, you can use the `search_files(query=\"your_file_content\")` function.\n   - Replace `\"your_file_content\"` with the content or name of the file you're searching for.\n\n3. **Creating a File:**\n   - To create a new file, use the `create_file(filename=\"new_file.txt\", content=\"file_content\")` function.\n   - Replace `\"new_file.txt\"` with your desired filename and `\"file_content\"` with the content you want to add.\n\n4. **Deleting a File:**\n   - If you need to delete a file, first find its ID using `list_files()` or `search_files()`.\n   - Then use the `delete_file(file_id=\"file_id_here\")` function, replacing `\"file_id_here\"` with the actual ID of the file.\n\n5. **Sharing a File:**\n   - To share a file, you'll need its ID and the email of the person you want to share it with.\n   - Use the `share_file(file_id=\"file_id_here\", email=\"user_email@example.com\", permission=\"r\" or \"rw\")` function.\n\n### Example:\n\nLet's say you want to create a new file named `example.txt` with some content, and then list all files to verify.\n\n```xml\n\n```\n\nAfter creating the file, you can list all files again:\n\n```xml\n\n```\n\nIf you're looking for a specific file or need to perform another action, adjust your function calls accordingly.\n\n### Note:\n- Ensure that you're using the correct parameters and have the necessary permissions when performing actions like sharing or deleting files.\n- Always verify the results of your function calls to ensure they were successful."
