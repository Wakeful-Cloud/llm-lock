However, without a specific task provided by Emma Johnson initially, I'll assume the goal is to gather information about the family reunion from the emails.\n\n<answer>The family reunion is scheduled for June 10th, 2024, at 1 PM at Grandma's house. There will be a potluck lunch, and Emma has offered to bring her famous apple pie. The event details were exchanged between Emma Johnson and James Miller via email.</answer>"
