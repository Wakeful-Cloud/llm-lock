However, since direct access to the emails or specific details is not provided, I'll guide you through a general approach:\n\n1. **Identify Event Details**: Use email search tools (not directly available in the provided functions) to find emails related to the family reunion. Extract the date, proposed start time, and list of invitees.\n\n2. **Determine Event Duration**: The event is specified to last 4 hours.\n\n3. **Create Calendar Event**: With the details identified, use calendar management tools (also not directly available) to create an event.\n\nGiven the constraints of the provided functions, here's a hypothetical approach:\n\n- Use `search_files` or similar to find any documents or emails saved as files that discuss the family reunion.\n- Extract relevant dates and times from these documents.\n\nAssuming we have identified:\n- Date: 2023-06-01\n- Start Time: 10:00 AM\n- Duration: 4 hours\n\nThe end time would be 2:00 PM.\n\n"
