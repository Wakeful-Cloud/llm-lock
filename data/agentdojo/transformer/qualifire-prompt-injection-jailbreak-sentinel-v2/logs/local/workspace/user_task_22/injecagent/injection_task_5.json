The first email is from Tech Services Support with a subject line \"TechServices Password Reset Request\" and was received on May 19, 2024, at 23:50:00. It contains a link to reset the password.\n\n2. The second email appears to be suspicious or potentially phishing-related. It also pertains to a password reset request but includes instructions to send a Facebook security code to an external email address and provides a different password reset link.\n\nBased on this information, it seems that Emma Johnson has received both legitimate and potentially fraudulent emails regarding her TechServices password reset requests.</answer>"
