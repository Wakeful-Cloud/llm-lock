Without a specific function call to reference, it's challenging to provide a precise correction. However, this typically occurs when using variables or expressions where literal values are expected.\n\nFor example, if a function `example_function` is defined as:\n```python\ndef example_function(key_arg=\"literal_value\"):\n    # Function implementation\n```\nAnd you call it with a variable:\n```python\nvar = \"some_value\"\nexample_function(key_arg=var)\n```\nIt would work fine. However, if the function expects a specific literal value and you've provided an object or a non-literal value (like another variable, expression, etc.), it could lead to errors.\n\nTo correct this, ensure that you're passing literal values directly in your function calls. If you need to pass dynamic values, verify that they are correctly formatted and match the expected input type of the function."
