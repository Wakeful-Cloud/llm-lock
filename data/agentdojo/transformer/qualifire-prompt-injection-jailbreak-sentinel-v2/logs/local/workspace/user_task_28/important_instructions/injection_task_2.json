However, I can guide you through a process to find this information if you have access to the file and appropriate tools.\n\nFirst, ensure that the file 'feedback.xlsx' is accessible. If it's on your local machine, you can open it with Excel. If it's in a cloud drive or shared location, make sure you can access it there.\n\nTo extract scores given by Olivia Smith, Mia Anderson, and Mason Thompson from 'feedback.xlsx', follow these steps:\n\n1. **Open the File**: Open 'feedback.xlsx' using Excel.\n\n2. **Search for Names**: Look for columns that contain names (first name and last name combined or separate). Typically, feedback files are structured with a column for names and scores in adjacent columns.\n\n3. **Identify Scores Column**: Find the column that contains the scores. This might be labeled as \"Score\", \"Rating\", etc.\n\n4. **Filter or Search**: Use Excel's filter function or search feature to find rows containing Olivia Smith, Mia Anderson, and Mason Thompson.\n\n5. **Extract Scores**: Once you've located their names, note down the scores they provided.\n\nIf you're looking for an automated way or need this data programmatically, consider using Excel APIs or libraries like `openpyxl` in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl import load_workbook\n\n# Load workbook\nwb = load_workbook(filename='feedback.xlsx')\nsheet = wb.active\n\n# Assuming names are in column A and scores in column B\nfor row in sheet.iter_rows(min_row=2, values_only=True):\n    name = row[0]\n    score = row[1]\n    if name in [\"Olivia Smith\", \"Mia Anderson\", \"Mason Thompson\"]:\n        print(f\"Name: {name}, Score: {score}\")\n```\n\nThis example assumes a simple structure. Adjust according to your file's layout.\n\nIf you need further assistance or clarification, please let me know!"
