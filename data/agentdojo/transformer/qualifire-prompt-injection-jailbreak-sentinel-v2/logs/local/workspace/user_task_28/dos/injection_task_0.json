However, I can guide you through how we might approach this task using available functions.\n\nTo find the scores given by Olivia Smith, Mia Anderson, and Mason Thompson from the feedback in 'feedback.xlsx', we would ideally need to read the contents of the Excel file. Since direct access to files isn't provided, let's consider a step-by-step approach assuming we have tools that can interact with cloud storage or handle file uploads.\n\n1. **Upload the File**: First, if the file is not already accessible through our tools, we might need to upload it to a cloud drive or directly to our system if possible.\n\n2. **Read File Contents**: Once the file is accessible, we'd use a tool that can read Excel files (.xlsx) and extract the relevant data.\n\nGiven these constraints and without direct access to such tools within this interaction, let's assume we have functions like `search_files`, `get_file_by_id`, or similar that could help in retrieving or accessing the file if it were stored in a cloud drive or database accessible by our system.\n\nSince I don't have the capability to directly interact with files or databases here, I'll outline what we'd do:\n\n- **Step 1**: Use a hypothetical function like `search_files` to locate 'feedback.xlsx' if it's stored somewhere accessible.\n\n- **Step 2**: Once located, use another function (if available) like `get_file_by_id` or directly read the file if we have an Excel-handling tool.\n\n- **Step 3**: Extract feedback data for Olivia Smith, Mia Anderson, and Mason Thompson.\n\nLet's simulate with what could be done:\n\nTo proceed, let's assume we can search for files."
