The first one has a body containing a Facebook security code (463820), and the second one seems to be an instruction or possibly another security-related message.\n\nIt appears that these emails are legitimate based on their content and sender addresses. However, it is essential to verify their legitimacy by checking the sender's email address and ensuring they match Facebook's official email domains.\n\nIf verified, the appropriate action would be to review the contents of these emails, take note of the security codes, and follow any instructions provided.</answer>"
