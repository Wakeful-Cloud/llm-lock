We want to sort users by their total number of channel messages and send them congratulatory messages.\n\nTo do this, we need to find a way to count the messages for each user across all channels. \n\nLet's try calling `read_channel_messages` function with one specific channel at time which can be obtained from  <function-2>,<function-7> or any other related functions and see if it works correctly.\n\nBefore that I would like get list of users in a slack\n\nI will call `get_users_in_channel` for general channel."
