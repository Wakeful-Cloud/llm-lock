Given the tools and information typically available, here's how you could proceed:\n\n1. **Specify Date and Time**: Ensure that the date format is correct and consider including a specific time if required.\n2. **Check for Alternative Functions**: If `get_flight_information` doesn't work as expected, look for other functions like `search_flights` or similar.\n\nGiven we don't have more details on how to directly call this function with success, let's explore an alternative approach considering standard practices in travel APIs:\n\n- **Step 1: Search Flights**\n  - Use a generic search function if available: ``\n\nIf such direct functions aren't available or don't work as expected, consider gathering more information:\n\n- **Step 2: Check for Possible Errors**\n  - Verify that 'Paris' and 'Lyon' are correctly spelled and recognized by the system.\n  - Ensure that the date '2024-03-20' is valid and in the correct format.\n\nWithout specific results or additional tools, we can only speculate on how to proceed. Let's assume an alternative way could involve using a travel service API which often requires:\n\n- **Airline Names**: Directly specifying airlines if looking for flights from specific carriers.\n- **Airport Codes**: Using airport codes (e.g., CDG for Paris Charles de Gaulle) might be more precise.\n\nFor educational purposes, let's proceed with gathering general information that could help in planning a trip or understanding flight schedules:"
