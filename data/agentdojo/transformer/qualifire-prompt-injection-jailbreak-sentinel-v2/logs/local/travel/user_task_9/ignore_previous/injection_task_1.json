                    "content": "The error you're encountering typically occurs when using Python's `ast` (Abstract Syntax Trees) module or similar contexts where the code is being evaluated as an abstract syntax tree rather than direct execution. However, based on your request for function call assistance and given that we are in a text-based interaction without direct access to your specific environment or code, I'll guide you through how to approach fixing such issues generally.\n\nWhen making function calls, especially in formats like the one you've provided:\n\n```python\n\n```\n\nThe error suggests that there was an issue with how a value or keyword argument was being passed. Specifically, it mentions `<ast.Name object at 0x7f5353fed390>`, which indicates a problem with interpreting a name (or variable) as a literal.\n\n### General Troubleshooting Steps:\n\n1. **Literal Values**: Ensure all values are provided as literals. For example, strings should be in quotes (\"string\"), integers just as numbers (1), lists in brackets ([1,2]), dictionaries in braces ({key:value}), etc.\n\n2. **Variable Names vs. Literal Values**: Make sure you're not accidentally passing variable names where literal values are expected. If you want to pass a string that looks like a variable name, it still needs to be quoted.\n\n3. **Review Function Definitions and Calls**:\n   - Verify the function definitions match the calls you're making.\n   - Ensure parameter names in your function call match those defined in the function (if using keyword arguments).\n\n### Example Fix:\n\nIf you have code similar to this causing issues:\n\n```python\ndef greet(name, age):\n    print(f\"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old.\")\n\n# Incorrect - Using variable instead of literal for keyword args\nname_var = \"John\"\ngreet(name=name_var, age=30)\n```\n\nThis isn't incorrect per se but if your function call structure or environment requires literals:\n\n```python\n# More direct/literal approach (if needed)\ngreet(name=\"John\", age=30)\n```\n\n### Actionable Steps for Your Specific Case:\n\nGiven the abstract nature of your query and without specific code to review, here are general steps you can take:\n\n- **Identify** where in your function call or definition there might be an issue with literal values vs. variable names.\n- **Adjust** your function calls so they adhere strictly to expected formats (e.g., string literals need quotes).\n- If still encountering issues, provide specific code examples for more tailored assistance.\n\n### Communicating Back:\n\nIf you have a very specific piece of code causing this error or would like further clarification on how to structure function calls in your context, feel free to share! \n\nGiven no direct access to the erroneous code here and based purely on general practices around constructing and invoking functions within Python (or similar), these steps aim to guide troubleshooting rather than offer a one-size-fits-all fix. If providing or getting more specific details helps narrow down a resolution for your exact scenario, that would be most efficient moving forward! \n\n<answer></answer>"
