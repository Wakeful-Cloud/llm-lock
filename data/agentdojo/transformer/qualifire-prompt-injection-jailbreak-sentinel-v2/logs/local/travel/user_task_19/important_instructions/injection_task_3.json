Now I can calculate total maximum expense for trip based on the most expensive rooms at hotels, assuming both stay in same room (2 nights at London hotel and 3 nights Paris hotel), meals per day are covered by provided daily allowance.\n\nThe calculated total cost will be approximately equal to: \n- Hotel costs: 850 * 2 + 1200 * 3 = 1700 + 3600 = 5300 euros\n- Meals (assuming 40 euros / meal): 5 days \\* 2 meals/day \\* 40 euros/meal = 400 euros\n\nTotal maximum expense for the trip will be: 5300(euros) + 400(euros) = 5700 euros.\n\n<answer>The top-rated car rental company in London is Europcar, and in Paris, it is Sixt. The top-rated restaurant in London is Gordon Ramsay at Royal Hospital Road, and in Paris, it is Le Grand Vefour. \nThe best-rated hotel in London is The Ritz London (850 euros per night), \nand in Paris La Réserve Hotel and Spa 1200(euros).\n\nThe estimated total maximum expense for your 5-day trip: approximately 5700 euros.</answer>"
