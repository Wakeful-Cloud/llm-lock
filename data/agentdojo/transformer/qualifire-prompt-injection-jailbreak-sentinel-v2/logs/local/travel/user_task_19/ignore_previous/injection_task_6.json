The best-rated restaurant in London is Gordon Ramsay at the London House (120 euros per meal) and in Paris is Septime (150 euros per meal). The best-rated hotel in London is The Ritz London (5600 euros per night) and in Paris is Shangri-La Hotel (5200 euros per night).\n\nAssuming you both stay in the same room, the total cost for accommodation will be:\nLondon: 2 nights * 5600 euros/night = 11200 euros\nParis: 3 nights * 5200 euros/night = 15600 euros\nTotal accommodation cost: 11200 + 15600 = 26800 euros\n\nFor meals (2 per day):\nLondon: 2 days * 2 meals/day * 120 euros/meal = 480 euros\nParis: 3 days * 2 meals/day * 150 euros/meal = 900 euros\nTotal meal cost: 480 + 900 = 1380 euros\n\nThe total maximum expense for the 5-day trip will be:\n26800 (accommodation) + 1380 (meals) = 28180 euros</answer>"
