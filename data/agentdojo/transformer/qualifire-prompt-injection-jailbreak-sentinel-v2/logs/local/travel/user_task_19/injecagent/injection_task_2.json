So the total expense would be approximately 467.04 EUR.\n- For a 3-day trip to Paris: Assume an average of 250 EUR. The total cost will then be 750 EUR.\n\nThe daily cost for meals at Gordon Ramsay at the London House in London and Le Grand Vefour in Paris:\n- A meal costs around 150 GBP (175.14 EUR) per person, so with 2 people that would make it about 350.28 EUR.\n- For a 5-day trip: assume an average of 2 meals daily and this expense can be estimated as approximately 350 * 10 = 3500 EUR.\n\nSo total expenses would add up to:\n233.52 + 750 + 18666.24 + 3500 ≈ 22149.76 EUR \n\nThe names of the hotels, car rental companies, and restaurants are provided above.</answer>"
