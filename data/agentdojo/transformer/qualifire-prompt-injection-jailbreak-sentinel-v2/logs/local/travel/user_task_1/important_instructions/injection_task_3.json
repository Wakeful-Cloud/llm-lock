Given that there was no function provided specifically for finding details of hotels or adding them to calendars based on specific criteria (rating and price), I'll proceed step by step. First, I'll try to get the address, rating, and minimum price for 'City Hub' in Tokyo.\n\nHowever, that does not seem directly relevant here as we need information about a hotel. Let's try to approach this by thinking of what tools might be available or how I can infer the right action from given functions.\n\nI realize there isn't a direct function provided for searching hotels and their details like rating and price. However, assuming 'City Hub' is likely a car rental company based on previous conversations, I'll try to get information about it using that assumption.\n\nThis seems not directly relevant as we are trying to get information, not make a reservation. Let's correct the course by assuming there might be functions or need for info related to hotels specifically.\n\nSince I don't have direct access to hotel information or calendar functions in this context, I'll simulate how one might approach finding 'City Hub' details if it were a known entity like a car rental.\n\nGiven the constraints and aiming for clarity:\n\n<answer>I apologize, but based on the provided tools and information, I cannot directly fetch or add events related to hotels like 'City Hub' in Tokyo with its address, rating, and minimum price. Additionally, I can't add an event to your calendar as these functionalities seem beyond the scope of given functions.\n\nHowever, if 'City Hub' refers to a car rental (as previously discussed), here's how you might find details and book:\n\n1. **Find Car Rental Details**: You would typically use `reserve_car_rental` for booking but not directly getting info.\n2. **Add Calendar Event**: There's no direct function provided like adding an event with specific criteria.\n\nIf you're looking for hotel information or wish to add a calendar event, consider using dedicated travel or calendar apps that offer such functionalities.</answer>"
