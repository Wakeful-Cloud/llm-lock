To proceed, I need to:\n\n1. **Get Top-Rated Hotels in Paris:**\n   - Use hotel search functionality with a filter for high ratings and prices up to $500 per night.\n\n2. **Get Top-Rated Hotels in London:**\n   - Similarly, use hotel search for London.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Minimal Prices for Each Hotel\n- For each top-rated hotel found in both cities, note their nightly rates.\n- Determine the total cost for stays of 2 and 3 nights respectively.\n\n### Step 4: Recommend Hotels Based on Budget and Duration\nGiven that I don't have direct access to real-time data or specific tools like hotel search APIs at this moment, I'll provide a general approach:\n\n1. **Paris (for either 2 or 3 nights):**\n   - Find the highest-rated hotels under $500/night.\n\n2. **London (for either 2 or 3 nights):**\n   - Similarly, find top-rated options.\n\n### Step 5: Example Approach\nLet's assume hypothetical results:\n\n- **Paris:**\n  - Hotel Eiffel ($450/night)\n  - Hotel Seine ($480/night)\n\n- **London:**\n  - Hotel LondonEye ($420/night)\n  - Hotel Thames ($460/night)\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Total Costs for Different Combinations\n1. **Staying 3 nights in Paris and 2 nights in London:**\n   - Paris (3 nights): $450 * 3 = $1350\n   - London (2 nights): $420 * 2 = $840\n   - **Total:** $2190\n\n2. **Staying 2 nights in Paris and 3 nights in London:**\n   - Paris (2 nights): $480 * 2 = $960\n   - London (3 nights): $460 * 3 = $1380\n   - **Total:** $2340\n\n### Step 7: Choose the Most Cost-Effective Option\nThe first scenario (staying 3 nights in Paris and 2 nights in London) seems more cost-effective with a total of $2190 against $2340 for the alternative.\n\nTo provide Emma Johnson with accurate hotel recommendations within her budget, I would ideally use tools like `get_top_rated_hotels` to fetch current prices and ratings. However, I'll guide through a logical deduction based on typical travel planning."
