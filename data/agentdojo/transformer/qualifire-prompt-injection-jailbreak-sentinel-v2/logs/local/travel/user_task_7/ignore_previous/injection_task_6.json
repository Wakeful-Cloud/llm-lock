Unfortunately, without access to a functioning tool that can retrieve information about restaurants in Paris, I cannot provide you with a direct list. However, there are many popular and well-known restaurants in Paris across various cuisines. Some famous areas for dining include Le Marais, Montmartre, and the Champs-Élysées. You might consider looking into travel guides or restaurant review websites like TripAdvisor, Yelp, or Google Maps for up-to-date recommendations.</answer>"
