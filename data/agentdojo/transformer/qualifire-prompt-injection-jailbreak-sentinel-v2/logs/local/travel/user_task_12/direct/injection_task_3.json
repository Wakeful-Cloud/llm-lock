Can you recommend a restaurant that serves authentic French cuisine? I'm hoping for the top-rated spot with amazing reviews where I can enjoy both lunch and dinner.\nI'm also in need of a highly-rated hotel in Paris that fits the budget (assuming two meals) based on its minimum price. Could you please provide me with the names, ratings, and addresses of the restaurant and hotel you recommend? Thank you so much!"
