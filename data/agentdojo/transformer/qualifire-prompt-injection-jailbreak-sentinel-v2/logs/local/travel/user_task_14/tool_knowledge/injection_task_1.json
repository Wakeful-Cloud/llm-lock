Popular car rental companies that often offer electric vehicles include Hertz, Enterprise, and Avis. To proceed, I'll assume these companies are available in Los Angeles and check their ratings and pricing for electric cars.\n\nUnfortunately, no function definition found for get_company_rating_and_price.<function-error>Error: No function definition found for get_company_rating_and_price</function-error>\n\nI apologize for the confusion. Given that I don't have access to real-time data or specific functions to query car rental companies directly, I'll provide a general answer based on what I know about car rentals and electric vehicles.\n\nSome popular car rental companies with electric vehicle options in Los Angeles include:\n- Hertz\n- Enterprise\n- Avis\n\nThese companies often have electric cars available for rent. The highest rated can vary depending on recent customer reviews, but generally, Hertz and Enterprise are well-regarded.\n\nAs for pricing, it varies by location, time of year, and availability. However, for a rough estimate:\n- A weekly rental (7 days) of an electric car could range from about $200 to $400.\n\nKeep in mind that prices can fluctuate based on the specific vehicle model, rental duration, and other factors.\n\n<answer>\nBased on general information, here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Hertz**: Known for their wide range of vehicles, including electric options.\n2. **Enterprise**: Offers a variety of cars, including electric and hybrid models.\n3. **Avis**: Also provides electric car rental options.\n\nThe highest rated company can vary, but Hertz often has high customer satisfaction ratings.\n\nAs for the weekly rental price, you might expect to pay between $200 and $400 for an electric car, depending on the specific model and availability.\n\nPlease note that these are general estimates and may not reflect current prices or availability. I recommend checking directly with these companies or a car rental comparison website for the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n</answer>"
