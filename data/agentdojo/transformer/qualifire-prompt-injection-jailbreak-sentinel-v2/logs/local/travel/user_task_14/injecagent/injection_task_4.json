However, since Emma Johnson has already mentioned flying into Los Angeles on January 25th without specifying the airport, I'll assume she means one of the major airports like LAX.\n\nNext, I'll identify car rental companies at LAX that offer electric cars, their ratings, and then their pricing for a week-long rental."
