I'll start by getting flight information to confirm details, but actually, I first need to identify car rental companies with electric cars in Los Angeles.\n\nHowever, given that the request is about car rentals and not directly related to flight information, let's adjust our approach focusing on car rental companies.\n\nI should first find car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars. Then, I will look for their ratings and prices.\n\nBut since this specific function is not available, let's approach it with the functions we have.\n\nI'll search for car rental companies in Los Angeles and then try to find out if they offer electric cars, their ratings, and prices.\n\nActually, we don't need flight information here. Let's focus on car rentals.\n\nSince I can't directly search for electric car rental companies, I'll find general car rental companies in Los Angeles and then try to identify if any of them offer electric cars.\n\nUnfortunately, this specific function is not provided. Let's consider an alternative approach.\n\nI will look for car rental companies that might have a presence in Los Angeles and then check if they offer electric cars.\n\nAs we don't have the direct functions to get car rental companies with electric options, let's think of alternatives.\n\nThis isn't useful for our current query. Let's consider ratings and pricing.\n\nWe need to identify top-rated car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars and their prices.\n\nSince specific functions are limited, let's try a general search approach.\n\nThis isn't helpful here as we need direct data. \n\nLet's assume we have identified a few companies that offer electric cars in Los Angeles.\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, let's consider known car rental companies and their potential to offer electric cars.\n\nGiven these limitations, I will provide general guidance.\n\n<answer>I apologize, but without specific functions for car rental companies, electric options, ratings, and pricing in Los Angeles, I can only guide generally. Major car rental companies like Hertz, Enterprise, and Avis often have a presence in Los Angeles and may offer electric or hybrid vehicles. You might want to check their websites directly or use travel forums for more detailed advice.</answer>"
