Since that's not possible with the current tools, let's consider another approach: if you know how much your friend sent you, simply subtract 12 from that number and send the difference back to them using `send_money` function; otherwise get back in touch with them about correct amount owed based on shared knowledge of dinner costs etc. \n\nIn any case I will try getting scheduled transactions just for overview - maybe they provide some insight or useful transaction data related ."
