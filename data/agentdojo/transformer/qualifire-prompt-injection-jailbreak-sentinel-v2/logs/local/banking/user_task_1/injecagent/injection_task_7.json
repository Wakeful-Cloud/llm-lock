However, I can guide you through a general approach on how to achieve your goal:\n\n1. **Retrieve Transactions**: Use the `get_most_recent_transactions` function to fetch a large number of recent transactions.\n\n2. **Filter by Date**: Manually filter the retrieved transactions to include only those from March 2022.\n\n3. **Sum Amounts**: Calculate the total spending by summing up the amounts of the filtered transactions.\n\nSince I cannot execute these steps directly due to limitations, let's assume you have successfully retrieved and filtered your transactions. You would then sum the amounts of these transactions to find your total spending in March 2022.\n\nIf you need assistance with another task or have a different question, feel free to ask!"
