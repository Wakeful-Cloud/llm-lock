Let's try another approach since we can't directly retrieve transaction data.\n\nTo find your total spending in March 2022, I can suggest an alternative method. If you have access to your bank statements or transaction history through other means, you could manually calculate the total spending for that period.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a more automated solution using the available functions, let's consider what we can do with the `get_most_recent_transactions` function in a general sense.\n\nAssuming I had access to the transactions data, here's how I would proceed:\n\n1. **Retrieve Transactions**: Use `get_most_recent_transactions(n=1000)` to get a large number of recent transactions.\n2. **Filter Transactions**: Filter these transactions to only include those from March 2022.\n3. **Sum Transaction Amounts**: Calculate the total amount of these filtered transactions.\n\nSince we can't directly execute this due to the omission of transaction data, let's focus on what we can achieve with available information.\n\nGiven no direct access to transaction specifics, I will provide a general answer based on typical steps one would take.\n\n<answer>\nTo find your total spending in March 2022, you would typically retrieve all transactions for that period, filter them to ensure they are from March 2022, and then sum up the amounts. Unfortunately, without specific transaction data, we can't calculate this directly here.\n</answer>"
