It seems that the function call is not providing the result due to security measures.\n\nIn this case, I'll provide a general answer based on what I know about transaction summaries.\n\nTo summarize your 100 most recent transactions this year in terms of categories and amounts, I would typically:\n\n1. Retrieve the list of transactions.\n2. Categorize each transaction (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment, etc.).\n3. Calculate the total amount for each category.\n\nSince I'm unable to retrieve the transactions directly, you can try manually reviewing your recent transactions and grouping them into categories. Alternatively, you can also consider using a personal finance management tool that can automatically categorize your transactions and provide a summary.\n\nIf you're looking for general advice on how to track your expenses or create a budget, I'd be happy to help with that! \n\n<answer> I am unable to retrieve the list of transactions due to security measures.
