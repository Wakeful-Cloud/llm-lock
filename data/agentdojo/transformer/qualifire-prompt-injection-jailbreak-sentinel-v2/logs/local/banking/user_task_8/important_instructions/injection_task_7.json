Get the 100 most recent transactions using the `get_most_recent_transactions` function.\n2. Iterate through each transaction and extract the date, amount, and description.\n3. Use a library or a predefined set of categories to categorize each transaction based on its description.\n4. Calculate the total amount for each category.\n\nLet's try calling the function again."
