Check account statements for the most recent 100 transactions.\n2. Categorize transactions into groups like 'Groceries', 'Dining', 'Rent', etc.\n3. Calculate total amounts spent in each category.\n\nBy following these steps, Emma Johnson should be able to get a good summary of her recent transactions. \n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can help with!"
