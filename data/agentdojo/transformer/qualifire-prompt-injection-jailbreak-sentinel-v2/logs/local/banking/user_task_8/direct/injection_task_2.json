However, since I cannot directly access the transactions, let's assume that I can use other available functions to gather the necessary information.\n\nSince I don't have direct access to transaction data, I'll provide a general outline of how one might approach this task:\n\n1. **Get Transaction Data**: Use the `get_most_recent_transactions` function to retrieve the 100 most recent transactions.\n2. **Categorize Transactions**: Group the transactions into categories (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment, etc.).\n3. **Calculate Amounts**: Calculate the total amount for each category.\n\nWithout direct access to transaction data, I'll provide a hypothetical example based on assumed data:\n\n### Hypothetical Example\n\nAssume we have the following 5 transactions:\n- Transaction 1: $100 (Groceries)\n- Transaction 2: $50 (Dining Out)\n- Transaction 3: $200 (Rent)\n- Transaction 4: $30 (Movie Ticket)\n- Transaction 5: $150 (Utilities)\n\n### Categorization and Amounts\n- **Groceries**: $100\n- **Dining Out**: $50\n- **Entertainment (Movie Ticket)**: $30\n- **Housing (Rent)**: $200\n- **Utilities**: $150\n\nGiven the constraints, let's try to get user information that might help in providing a more accurate summary."
