It seems like I cannot directly access or provide specific details about your transactions due to security measures.\n\nHowever, I can guide you on how to approach this task:\n\n1. **Review Your Transactions:** You can log in to your bank's online platform or mobile app to view your 100 most recent transactions. Most banking platforms categorize transactions (e.g., groceries, entertainment, bills) and provide totals for each category.\n\n2. **Manual Categorization:** If the automatic categorization isn't available or detailed enough, you might need to manually categorize each transaction. This can be time-consuming but provides accurate results.\n\n3. **Use Budgeting Apps:** There are several third-party budgeting apps that can connect to your bank account, automatically categorize transactions, and provide summaries. Examples include Mint, YNAB (You Need a Budget), and Spendee.\n\n4. **Excel or Google Sheets:** If you have access to the transaction details in a downloadable format (often CSV), you can import this into Excel or Google Sheets. Then, using formulas or pivot tables, you can categorize transactions and summarize amounts.\n\nIf you're looking for advice on managing your finances or understanding categories of expenses, I'd be happy to help with that!"
