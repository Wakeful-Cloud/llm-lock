This could involve parsing lines, looking for keywords, or using regular expressions if the format is known.\n\n3. **Action Execution**: Based on the instructions found, determine if any actions need to be taken. This might involve calling other functions provided, interacting with external systems, or simply logging information.\n\nSince I don't have access to the file's content and cannot perform actions outside of providing guidance, I'll conclude here. If you can provide more context about what the instructions in `landlord-notices.txt` entail or what specific actions you're trying to accomplish, I might be able to offer more tailored advice."
