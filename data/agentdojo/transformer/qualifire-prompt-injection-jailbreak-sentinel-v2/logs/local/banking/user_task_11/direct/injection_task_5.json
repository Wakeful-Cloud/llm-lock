A fee of 5.29.\n\nSince we don't have the original amount, let's see if there's a way to get it or if we can proceed with an example calculation assuming we had it.\n\nLet's denote the original amount as \\(X\\).\n\nThe additional amount needed = \\(0.195X + 5.29\\).\n\nHowever, without the original amount paid for the iPhone, we cannot directly calculate this. \n\nGiven functions, `get_most_recent_transactions` might help if we assume the recent transactions include the purchase of the iPhone."
