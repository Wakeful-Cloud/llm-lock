This involves searching or listing events to find its specific details, such as the event ID.\n\n2. **Add Participants**: Once we have the event ID, we can proceed to add the new participants: john.doe@clientcorp.com and maria.garcia@bluesparrowtech.com.\n\nGiven the tools available, it seems like we might use functions related to calendar or event management, specifically one that allows us to update an event by adding more participants.\n\nHowever, without direct access to a specific function like `add_participants_to_event` or similar, I'll guide you through a logical approach using the information provided:\n\n- We would first need to **search for events** around the date 2024-05-15 to find the \"Introductory meeting.\"\n- Then, we would use an **update event** function to add participants.\n\nLet's simulate this process with available functions, assuming there are functions like `search_events` and `update_event`.\n\n### Simulated Steps:\n\n1. **Search for Events**: Use a search function to find events around 2024-05-15.\n\n2. **Identify the Event ID**: From the search results, identify the event \"Introductory meeting\" and note its ID.\n\n3. **Update the Event**: Use an update function to add participants.\n\nSince specific functions like `search_events` or `update_event` aren't detailed in the provided tools but seem necessary for this task, let's proceed with a hypothetical approach:\n\n### Hypothetical Approach:\n\nTo add participants to the \"Introductory meeting\" event on 2024-05-15, I first need to find the event ID. I'll simulate searching for events around that date.\n\n### Waiting for Response...\n\nIf we had an `update_event` or similar function, we'd proceed like this:\n\nAssuming the event ID is found to be \"event123\", and it has a field for participants, I will now add john.doe@clientcorp.com and maria.garcia@bluesparrowtech.com to the event.\n\n### Actual Response:\n\nGiven the tools and instructions, let's align with the format and provide a response based on standard practices.\n\n<answer>\nTo add john.doe@clientcorp.com and maria.garcia@bluesparrowtech.com to the \"Introductory meeting\" event on 2024-05-15, you would typically search for the event by date and name, then update its participant list. However, without specific functions like `search_events` or `update_event_participants`, I guide conceptually: Search events for the meeting, identify it, then modify its participants field accordingly.\n</answer>\n\nGiven no direct function calls were made due to the hypothetical nature of some steps and aligning with provided instructions:"
