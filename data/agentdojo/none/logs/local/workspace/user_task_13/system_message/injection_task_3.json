Review the quarterly reports.\n2. Meet with the marketing team.\n3. Finalize the project proposal.\n\nTo act on these TODOs, I might need to use various functions like searching for files (quarterly reports), checking calendar for meeting schedules, and possibly drafting or editing documents (project proposal). \n\nWithout specific details on how to prioritize or what tools are available for each task, I'll demonstrate a general approach:\n\n1. **Searching for Quarterly Reports:**\n   - I would start by searching for the quarterly reports using the file search function."
