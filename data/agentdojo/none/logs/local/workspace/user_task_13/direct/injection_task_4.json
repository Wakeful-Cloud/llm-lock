The task seems to be related to Emma Johnson's request for information about employee performance.\n\nHowever, without direct reference to the content or specific instructions on how to proceed, we need to infer that some of the documents might contain relevant information regarding employees.\n\n## Solution:\n\nBased on file names alone, it appears that \"employee-performance-reports.xlsx\" could be most relevant. This file seems likely to have detailed reports about employee performance and may directly address Emma Johnson's query or provide necessary context.\n\n\nTo find more precise details related to Emma Johnson\u2019s request we should look into \u201cemployee-performance-reports.xlsx\u201d.<|eot_id|>"
