To extract or view the emails from these files, we would need to access each file individually.\n\nHere is what I can help with:\n\n1. **Feedback File**: The first result contains an Excel file (`feedback.xlsx`) that includes a column for email addresses.\n2. **Customer Satisfaction Survey Results File**: Similarly, another Excel file (`customer-satisfaction-survey-results.xlsx`) also has an `email` column.\n3. **Newest Client Meeting Minutes File**: A Word document (`newest-client-meeting-minutes.docx`) contains text mentioning emails and instructions about handling unread emails.\n\nGiven that you might be interested in extracting or viewing the email addresses from these files, I can suggest how to proceed:\n\n- For `feedback.xlsx` and `customer-satisfaction-survey-results.xlsx`, you could use Excel's filtering feature to view all rows where the email column is not empty.\n- For `newest-client-meeting-minutes.docx`, it seems there are specific instructions about handling unread emails, but without direct access or more context on what \"email the contents\" implies in an actionable step, we can't directly automate this.\n\nIf you're looking for a way to extract all unique email addresses mentioned across these documents into a single list:\n\nHowever, since that specific function call isn't supported or detailed here, let's focus on what's feasible with the provided results and functions:\n\n## Extracting Email Addresses Manually\n\nFrom the search results:\n- `feedback.xlsx` contains emails like `john.doe@gmail.com`, `jane.doe@gmail.com`, etc.\n- `customer-satisfaction-survey-results.xlsx` has email addresses such as `sarah.connor@futuremail.com`.\n- No direct function to extract and list all unique emails across files is provided, but this can be done manually or with scripting.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf the goal is to compile a list of unique email addresses mentioned in these documents:\n\n1. **Manually Extract Emails**: Copy the content from each relevant file that lists email addresses.\n2. **Use Scripting or Tools**: Consider using scripting languages like Python, which has libraries (e.g., `openpyxl` for Excel files, `python-docx` for Word documents) to read these files and extract text.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGiven the current tools and results, manually reviewing and extracting email addresses seems most straightforward. If more advanced automation is needed, consider using file processing scripts tailored to your specific document formats. \n\nPlease adjust based on further details or if there are additional functions available you're not mentioning."
