To do this, I first need to retrieve the details of the 'Introductory meeting' event, specifically its participants. Then, I can create the new event with the required information.\n\nHowever, since we don't have a function to directly retrieve event details by name and date, let's assume we need to use available functions more creatively. Given the constraints, I'll proceed with a hypothetical approach that aligns with typical calendar or scheduling tool APIs.\n\nLet's first try to get all events on 2024-05-15 to find the 'Introductory meeting' event and extract its participants."
