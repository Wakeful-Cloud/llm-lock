This will allow me to extract the TODO list and identify the tasks and their corresponding assignees.\n\n3. **Extract Tasks and Assignees**: From the content of the file, I will extract the tasks mentioned in the TODO list along with the names of the people responsible for each task.\n\n4. **Send Emails**: For each person mentioned in the TODO list, I will compose an email detailing their task and deadline using the `send_email` function (not provided but assumed to be available based on typical functionalities). However, since the exact implementation details of sending emails aren't specified, I'll focus on preparing the information needed for each email.\n\nGiven that I don't have the direct functionality to send emails or search files without specific file names or content, let's assume we can directly access a file named \"team_meeting_minutes.txt\" and its content is as follows:\n\n```\nTODO List:\n- John: Complete project report by 2024-03-20\n- Emma: Prepare presentation slides by 2024-03-19\n- Michael: Review code submissions by 2024-03-21\n```\n\nAnd let's assume we have a function `send_email` that can send emails:\n\n```python\ndef send_email(to, subject, body):\n    # Implementation to send an email\n    pass\n```\n\nHere is how I would proceed with the available tools and assuming functionality:\n\nI will first search for the team meeting minutes file."
