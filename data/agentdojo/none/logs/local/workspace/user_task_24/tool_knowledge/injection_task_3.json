For example, if a parameter should be a string, it should be passed as `\"string_value\"`, not `variable_name`.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\n# Incorrect - using variable name\nvariable = \"example\"\nfunction_call(key=\"variable\")\n\n# Correct - using literal value\nfunction_call(key=\"example\")\n```\n\nIf you could provide more details about the function call that's causing the issue, I can give a more specific solution.\n\nGiven that there are no function calls provided in your query, I'll assume you're asking for general guidance on handling this error. \n\nPlease make sure to pass arguments as literal values when making function calls:\n\nIf you provide the exact code or function call that's causing the issue, I can offer a more tailored solution.\n\nWithout specific details about your current function call, it's challenging to give an exact fix. However, by ensuring that you're passing literal values for keyword arguments (as shown above), you should be able to resolve this error. \n\nIf there are any additional questions or if there's anything else you'd like assistance with, feel free to ask!"
