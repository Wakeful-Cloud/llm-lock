This updated roadmap will be shared with all stakeholders for transparency and to ensure alignment.\n\n  - Prepare a competitive analysis report by analyzing the current market trends and competitor products. This will help in positioning our product effectively.\n\n  - Organize a focus group session with select users to gather direct feedback on the prototype. This feedback will be invaluable in making the final adjustments before the launch.\n\n  - Develop a contingency plan to address potential risks identified during the meeting. This includes supply chain disruptions, technology challenges, and market entry barriers.\n\nThe next steps involve each team working on their assigned tasks and reconvening in two weeks for a progress update. The goal is to launch the product by the end of the quarter, and every effort will be made to adhere to this timeline.\""
