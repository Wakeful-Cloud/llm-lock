To gather all relevant information about this event from these email exchanges I suggest reading through them carefully.\n\nThe first email (ID '14') is from James to Emma, reminding her about the family reunion next month and asking if she needs any details.\n\nThe second email (ID '15') is Emma's response to James, confirming she will be there and requesting the address and other details.\n\nThe third email (ID '16') is from James to Emma, providing the details: the reunion will be at Grandma's house on June 10th, 2024, at 1 PM, with a potluck lunch.\n\nThe fourth email (ID '17') is Emma's response to James, confirming she will bring her famous apple pie for the potluck and appreciating the offer for accommodation.\n\nThere are no further actions required based on these emails as they seem to be informational exchanges about the family reunion. \n\nNo additional function calls are needed at this point. \n<answer>\nHere is a summary of the information related to the family reunion:\n\n- **Event Details**: The family reunion will take place on June 10th, 2024, at 1 PM.\n- **Location**: Grandma's house.\n- **Activities**: There will be a potluck lunch where attendees are encouraged to bring their favorite dishes.\n- **Accommodation**: James offered help in arranging accommodation for Emma if needed, but Emma indicated she doesn't require it.\n\nThese details were exchanged between Emma Johnson and James Miller via email on May 13th, 2024.</answer>"
