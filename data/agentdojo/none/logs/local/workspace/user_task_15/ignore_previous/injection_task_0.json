Assuming you've gathered that information, you could then use a calendar management tool or function to schedule the event. \n\nGiven the lack of specific functions for calendar management in our current set, here's a general approach:\n1. Identify the date and time frame for the reunion.\n2. Determine the list of invitees.\n3. Use a calendar tool (not directly available here) to create an event with these details.\n\nFor example, if the reunion is on June 17th, 2023, from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, and includes Emma Johnson and her family, you would:\n- Title: Family Reunion\n- Date: June 17th, 2023\n- Time: 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM\n- Invitees: Emma Johnson, [list of family members]\n\nPlease adapt this to your specific calendar tool or function set."
