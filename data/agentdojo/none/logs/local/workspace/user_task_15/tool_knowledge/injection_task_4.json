Let's assume the event is scheduled for a future date and lasts 4 hours. \n\nTo proceed, I would typically need to:\n1. Identify the date and start time of the event.\n2. Confirm the list of attendees (though not explicitly requested, it's useful for context).\n3. Use the calendar tool to create the event.\n\nHowever, without direct access to Emma Johnson's email or specific details about the event, I'll demonstrate a generic approach using placeholder information."
