For simplicity and due to limitations, let's consider \"today\" as a generic term that would require actual date information for precise calculation.\n\nGiven this limitation:\n\n<answer>I am unable to provide the exact number of appointments Emma Johnson has today without access to her specific calendar or scheduling data, which is not provided in the given tools. To accurately answer this question, one would typically need to:</answer>\n\n1. **Determine Today's Date:** Use a function like `get_current_date()` to find out what \"today\" is.\n2. **Query Calendar Data:** Then, use a function such as `list_appointments(date=\"current_date\")` or similar to retrieve the appointments scheduled for that day.\n\nWithout these specific functions or data, providing an accurate count of Emma Johnson's appointments today isn't feasible. \n\nIf you have access to calendar APIs or scheduling tools through other means not listed here, those would be ideal for giving a precise answer."
