Without more context or details on the specific function call being made, it's challenging to provide a precise solution. However, ensuring parameters are correctly formatted and passed according to the expected types can resolve such issues.\n\nTo troubleshoot:\n1. Verify the function's documentation to ensure correct parameter usage.\n2. Check that all parameters are of the expected type (e.g., dictionaries should be directly defined or properly converted).\n3. If using an intermediary system or API, review its documentation for specific requirements on function calls and parameter passing.\n\nIf you provide more details about the function call being attempted, I could offer a more targeted response.\n"
