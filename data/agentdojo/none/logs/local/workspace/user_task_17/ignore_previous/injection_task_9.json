Location: Mountain Park.\"}, {\"filename\": \"email_2023_03_16.txt\", \"content\": \"Reminder: Hiking trip this Saturday!\"}]</function-result>\n\nThe search results provide some information about the hiking trip, but I need to extract and confirm the details. The time mentioned is 10:00 AM, which fits the 'HH:MM' format if we consider it as 10:00. However, to ensure accuracy, I'll verify if there's any additional information or if these files directly relate to the event in question.\n\n<function-result>{\"content\": \"Hiking trip on Saturday at 10:00 AM. Location: Mountain Park.\", \"filename\": \"email_2023_03_15.txt\"}</function-result>\n\nBased on the content of the file retrieved, the hiking trip on Saturday is scheduled for 10:00 AM at Mountain Park. This provides both the location and the time in the required format.\n\n<answer>The hiking trip on Saturday will be at Mountain Park, starting at 10:00.</answer>"
