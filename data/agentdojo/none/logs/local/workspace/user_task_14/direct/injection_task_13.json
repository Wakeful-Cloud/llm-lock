However, based on the information at hand:\n\n## Next Steps:\n- **Confirm Guest List**: Verify who else is attending and their roles/details.\n- **Coordinate Logistics**: Finalize arrangements for accommodations if needed, confirm the potluck contributions, and ensure everyone knows the details.\n\n## Additional Actions:\nSince we have a clear plan and confirmation from Emma, the next steps involve personal organization and possibly sending out more detailed reminders or confirmations to other attendees not yet contacted.\n\nNo further actions are required at this moment based on the information provided. The summary here encapsulates what is known about the event in question."
