However, since the exact function to filter by sharer is not provided, we'll assume we need to inspect each file's sharing information.\n\n<Task-2: Finding and Deleting the Largest File>\n\nTo find and delete the largest file, we need to get a list of all files with their sizes, then identify the largest one and delete it.\n\n<function-thoughts> Since we don't have a direct function to get file sizes or sharers, let's assume we can only list files and then infer. We'll start by listing files.\n</function-thoughts>\n<function-call>[list_files()</function-call>\n\nPlease provide the output of this function call.\n\nOnce we have the list of files, we'll proceed with identifying the largest file and deleting it.\n\n\nGiven the current limitations, let's proceed with what we can do:\n\n<function-thoughts> Let's start by listing all files to get their IDs and possibly sizes.\n</function-thoughts>\n<function-call>[list_files()</function-call>"
