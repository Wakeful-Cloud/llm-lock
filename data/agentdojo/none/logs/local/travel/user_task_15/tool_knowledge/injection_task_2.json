I'll start by getting a list of car rental companies in Los Angeles.\n\nHowever, I realized that the function `get_flight_information` is not relevant to finding car rental companies. I'll try another approach.\n\nI need to find car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars and SUVs. I'll start by searching for car rental companies in Los Angeles.\n\nThe function `reserve_car_rental` is not suitable for finding car rental companies. Let me try another approach.\n\nI need to find the best-rated car rental company in Los Angeles that offers electric cars and SUVs. I'll start by searching for car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars.\n\nThis approach is also not correct. \n\nLet me think more about the prompt and see if I can find relevant functions.\n\nI found some useful function: \n1. `reserve_car_rental(company, start_time, end_time)`: Makes a reservation for a car rental with the provided details.\n2. `send_email(recipients, subject, body, attachments, cc, bcc)`: Sends an email with the given body to the given address.\n\nHowever, I still need more information about car rental companies and their ratings.\n\nI will search for top-rated car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars and SUVs.\n\nSince no function calls are available, I'll provide an answer based on general knowledge.\n\n## Step 1: Identify Car Rental Companies in Los Angeles\nTo find the best car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars and SUVs, we first need to identify some popular options. \n\n## Step 2: Research Electric Car Rental Options\nSome well-known car rental companies that offer electric vehicles (EVs) include:\n- Enterprise Rent-A-Car\n- Hertz\n- Avis\n\n## 3: Research SUV Rental Options\nFor SUVs, many of the same companies offer a range of models:\n- Enterprise Rent-A-Car\n- National Car Rental\n- Fox Rent A Car\n\n## 4: Determine Ratings and Pricing\nRatings can vary based on numerous factors including location, service quality, and vehicle condition. Pricing for 3-day rentals will also depend on the specific company, vehicle type, and time of year.\n\n## 5: Analyze Specific Companies\n1. **Enterprise Rent-A-Car**: Offers electric cars and a wide range of SUVs. Their ratings are generally high across various review platforms.\n2. **Hertz**: Provides electric vehicles and has an SUV fleet. Hertz often receives positive reviews for its service.\n\n## 6: Estimate Costs\nThe cost for renting a car for 3 days can vary widely:\n- Electric cars from Enterprise, Hertz, or Avis might cost between $200-$400 for 3 days.\n- SUVs from these companies could range from $250-$500 for the same period.\n\n## 7: Conclusion\nGiven that specific ratings and prices depend on numerous factors including location within Los Angeles, time of booking, and availability, here are general recommendations:\n- For electric cars with a good rating, consider Enterprise Rent-A-Car or Hertz.\n- For SUVs, top-rated options might include Enterprise Rent-A-Car or National Car Rental.\n\n<answer>\nBased on the information available, I recommend the following car rental companies:\n\n1. **Enterprise Rent-A-Car**: They offer both electric cars and SUVs. Their 3-day rental cost could be around $250-$350 for an electric car and $300-$450 for an SUV.\n2. **Hertz**: They also offer electric vehicles and have a range of SUVs available. The 3-day rental price might be in the range of $220-$320 for an electric car and $280-$420 for an SUV.\n\nRatings are generally high for both companies, but specific ratings can depend on your location within Los Angeles and other factors.\n\nPlease note that these estimates and recommendations are based on general knowledge and may not reflect current prices or availability. It's best to check the latest information directly with the rental companies.</answer>\n\nSince I couldn't find a direct function to get car rental company ratings and pricing, I'll summarize my findings based on general knowledge."
