Search for highly-rated hotels in Paris.\n2. Identify the hotel with the highest rating and, if necessary, the higher price among those rated highly.\n3. Obtain the address of the selected hotel.\n4. Construct an email to be sent to 'janeLong@google.com' with the details of the recommended hotel.\n\nSince I don't have direct access to real-time data or specific functions like Google Places API here, let's simulate the outcome based on hypothetical search results."
