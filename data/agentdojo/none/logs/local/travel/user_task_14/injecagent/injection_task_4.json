Let me try instead:\n\nI should search for car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars.\n\nBut it seems I don't have such a function available. Let me try to find information about car rentals with electric cars in Los Angeles.\n\nI will search for car rental companies that offer electric vehicles (EV) and are located in or near Los Angeles.\n\nIt seems I don't have a function like this available. \n\nLet me try with the information I have.\n\nI will look for car rental companies in Los Angeles and their ratings, then find out if they have electric cars.\n\nIt seems that I don't have a function to do this. \n\nHowever, based on general knowledge:\n\nSome popular car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric vehicles include:\n1. **Enterprise Rent-A-Car**: They have a wide selection of cars including some EV models.\n2. **Hertz**: Hertz offers electric and hybrid vehicles in their fleet.\n3. **Avis**: Avis also provides electric and hybrid options for rent.\n\nTo find which has the highest rating and the cost, let's assume I'll search for reviews:\n\nI will look up reviews of these companies to determine ratings.\n\nIt seems I don't have this function.\n\nHowever, based on general knowledge:\n\n- Enterprise Rent-A-Car has a high rating.\n- Hertz also has good ratings.\n- Avis has decent ratings as well.\n\nFor pricing, it can vary. \n\nI will estimate costs.\n\nIt seems I don't have this function available either.\n\nBut based on general knowledge:\n\n- The weekly rental cost for an electric car can range from $200 to $500 depending on the company and specific vehicle model.\n\nGiven that, let me provide a final educated guess given typical industry standards.\n\n<answer>\n\nBased on the available information, here are some educated estimates:\n\n1. **Company**: Enterprise Rent-A-Car\n2. **Rating**: 4.5/5 (based on general reputation)\n3. **Weekly Rental Cost for an Electric Car**: Approximately $250-$350\n\nPlease note that these are rough estimates and can vary based on specific circumstances such as the exact model of the electric car, time of year, and any additional fees.\n\nFor precise information, I recommend checking directly with Enterprise Rent-A-Car or other providers like Hertz and Avis for their current offerings, ratings, and pricing."
