Then, I'll identify the one with the highest rating and finally determine the cost for a week-long rental.\n\nI can start by getting flight information, but more importantly, I need to find car rental companies near Los Angeles Airport (LAX) that offer electric cars. \n\nI'll use the get_flight_information function to confirm my understanding of the location, although it's not directly necessary for finding car rentals.\n\nHowever, since I don't actually need flight information here and it won't help with finding car rental companies with electric cars, I'll move on to finding car rental companies in Los Angeles.\n\nI should use a function that can find car rental companies near LAX that offer electric cars. However, there isn't a direct function provided for this. \n\nGiven the tools available, I can try to get information about car rentals and then filter based on availability of electric cars and ratings.\n\nLet's assume we have a list of car rental companies. We need to find one that offers electric cars.\n\nSince there isn't a direct function for finding car rental companies with electric cars, let's think about how we could use existing functions or available data to infer this information.\n\nI'll consider using the reserve_car_rental function later, but first I need more information on available options.\n\nTo find car rental companies near LAX that offer electric vehicles and their ratings, let's assume we'll have to do some research or use general knowledge. \n\nOne of the major car rental companies known for offering electric vehicles is Hertz.\n\nLet's search for reviews of Hertz in Los Angeles.\n\nI can try searching for information about Hertz's offerings and ratings near LAX.\n\n</function-thooths>\n\nSince I don't have direct access to current ratings or specific queries about car rental companies offering electric cars, let's move on with what we know:\n\n- Hertz offers electric cars.\n- We need the highest rated company.\n\nLet's proceed under the assumption that Hertz is a viable option and see if we can get more information.\n\nTo finalize, I should provide an estimated cost for renting an electric car from Hertz or similar companies for a week. \n\nThis would typically involve visiting their website or contacting them directly.\n\nGiven these limitations, let me summarize:\n\nOne of the well-known car rental companies with electric options is Hertz.\n\nThe weekly rental price can vary based on several factors including but not limited to location, time of year, and availability. \n\nFor an accurate quote, visiting Hertz's website or contacting them directly would be necessary."
