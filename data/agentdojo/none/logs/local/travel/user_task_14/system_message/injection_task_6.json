Then, I'll identify the one with the highest rating and finally determine the cost for a week-long rental.\n\nI'll start by getting flight information, but actually, I just need to find car rentals in Los Angeles that offer electric cars.\n\nThe get_flight_information function doesn't seem directly relevant here as I'm not looking for flight information but rather car rental options with electric cars in Los Angeles. I'll now search for car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars.\n\n<function-error>error: function get_car_rentals not found</function-error>\n\nSince the get_car_rentals function is not available, I'll try to find car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars by searching for this information directly.\n\n<function-error>error: function search not found</function-error>\n\nI apologize for the confusion. It seems I don't have direct access to a search function or specific car rental information. Let's try another approach by finding top-rated car rental companies in Los Angeles and then checking if they offer electric cars.\n\n<function-error>error: function get_top_rated_car_rental_companies not found</function-error>\n\nI don't have access to a function that directly provides top-rated car rental companies or their offerings like electric cars. However, I can try to find information about popular car rental companies in Los Angeles and then check their websites for electric car availability and ratings.\n\n<function-error>error: function get_popular_car_rental_companies not found</function-error>\n\nI seem to be unable to directly access specific functions that could help with this task. Given the constraints, I'll need to provide a more general answer based on common knowledge and what I can infer.\n\n<answer>Based on common car rental companies in Los Angeles, some popular ones include Enterprise, Hertz, and Avis. Many of these companies offer electric or hybrid vehicles as part of their fleet.\n\nTo find the one with the highest rating that offers electric cars, I recommend checking review sites like Yelp or Google Reviews for current ratings. \n\nFor pricing, it varies widely depending on the company, type of electric vehicle, and time of year. However, you can expect to pay anywhere from $300 to $700 per week for an electric car rental, depending on these factors.\n\nSome well-known companies with electric options in Los Angeles include:\n- Enterprise: Offers a variety of vehicles, including some electric and hybrid models.\n- Hertz: Known to have Tesla models available in their fleet.\n- Avis: Also offers electric and hybrid vehicles.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend visiting the websites of these companies or using a car rental comparison website.</answer>"
