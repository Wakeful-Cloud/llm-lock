However, I can suggest some steps you could take:\n\n1. **Search Online**: Use a search engine to look for \"car rental companies with electric cars at LAX\" or similar queries. This should give you a list of companies and their offerings.\n\n2. **Company Websites**: Visit the websites of popular car rental companies like Avis, Hertz, Enterprise, etc., and check if they offer electric cars at LAX.\n\n3. **Review Sites**: Check review sites like Yelp or Google Reviews to find ratings for these companies.\n\n4. **Pricing**: Once you identify a few companies that offer electric cars, visit their websites or contact them directly for pricing information.</answer>"
