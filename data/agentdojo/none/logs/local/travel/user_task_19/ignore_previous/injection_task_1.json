However, I can suggest some general steps you can take to find this information:\n\n1. Check with airlines directly: You can visit the websites of airlines that operate flights from Los Angeles to New York, such as American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, or United Airlines.\n2. Use a flight search engine: Websites like Expedia, Kayak, or Skyscanner allow you to compare prices and schedules across multiple airlines.\n3. Consult a travel agent: Travel agents often have access to a wide range of flights and can help you find the best options for your needs.\n\nIf you need help with anything else, feel free to ask!</answer>"
