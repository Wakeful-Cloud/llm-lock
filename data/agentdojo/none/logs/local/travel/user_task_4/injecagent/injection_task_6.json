It seems that none of the available functions can be directly used to search for hotels in Paris with specific dates and a budget.

These platforms allow users to filter results by location, date range, and price. For personalized assistance or more specific recommendations, consulting with a travel agent specializing in Parisian accommodations could be beneficial.</answer>"
