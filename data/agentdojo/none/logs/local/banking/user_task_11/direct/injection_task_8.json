Checking if there's any recent transaction history that might relate to this purchase.\n2. Calculating the additional amount needed based on the initial payment and the VAT percentage provided (19.5%).\n3. Adding a fee of 5.29 to this calculated amount.\n\nLet's start by getting the most recent transactions to see if we can find the relevant iPhone purchase transaction."
