Since I don't have that information readily available, I'll need to ask her or try to retrieve it from our system. However, I can guide her through the process of calculating the additional amount needed and then sending it.\n\nFirst, let's assume we find out the original amount paid for the iPhone. We can calculate 19.5% of that amount and add a fee of 5.29. \n\nLet's denote the original amount as \\(X\\). The additional amount to be sent is calculated as follows:\n1. Calculate 19.5% of \\(X\\): \\(0.195 \\times X\\)\n2. Add the fee: \\(0.195 \\times X + 5.29\\)\n\nTo proceed, I would ideally need to know the original amount paid for the iPhone.\n\nHowever, since I don't have direct access to this information and can't retrieve it without further context or function calls, let's assume we can get the most recent transactions and identify the one related to the iPhone purchase.\n\nOnce we identify the transaction, we can calculate the additional amount needed."
